You can already run Dart code on 
[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/),
and at Google I/O we demonstrated running Dart in a custom runtime running on
 [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)
that runs on Managed VMs.

Managed VMs and custom runtimes on the Google Cloud Platform are currently available in Limited Preview. You can find out more about Managed VMs from the [Google Cloud Platform Managed VMs](https://developers.google.com/cloud/managed-vms) documentation.

To participate in the discussion on running Dart on the server, and to stay informed with news and announcements, sign up for the
[cloud@dartlang.org](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cloud)
email list.

To learn more about writing server-side applications in Dart, you can read more about [writing HTTP Clients & Servers in Dart](/docs/tutorials/httpserver/).
