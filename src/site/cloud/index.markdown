# {{ page.title }}

You can already run Dart code on Google
[Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/),
but soon you will also be able to run Dart code on a Dart runtime for
Google [App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)
that runs on Managed VMs.

To participate in the discussion, and stay informed with news and
announcements, sign up for the
[cloud@dartlang.org](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cloud)
email list.
