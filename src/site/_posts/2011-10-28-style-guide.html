<p>
  I just finished putting the final touches on our first <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/">coding style guide</a> for Dart. Having a consistent style makes it easier for all of us to read each other's code. I think the Python and Ruby communities do a great job of this in particular, and I hope we can do something similar for Dart.
