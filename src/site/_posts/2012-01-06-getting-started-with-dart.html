<p>
Is taking a look at Dart one of your New Year's resolutions?
</p>

<p>
It's now as easy as watching 
<a href="/slides/2012/01/getting_started/index.html">Getting Started with Dart</a>, a 10-minute
screencast that introduces the latest Dart tooling, including the Dart Editor, Dart VM,
JavaScript compilers, frog server, and Dartium&mdash;a Chromium version that runs Dart code natively.
