<p>
  Dart Editor binaries are now available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Dart Editor is a lightweight, open-source editor based on Eclipse components. In addition to editing Dart programs, you can use Dart Editor to invoke the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler and launch Dart-based web apps. Get started with the <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/getting-started/editor/">Dart Editor tutorial</a>, where you can download the continuous or integration builds.
