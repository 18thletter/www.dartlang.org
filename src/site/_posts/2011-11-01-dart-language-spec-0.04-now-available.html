<p>
  Version 0.04 of the
  <a href="/docs/spec/index.html">Dart language spec</a>
  is now available.
</p>

<p>
  Changes include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> 7.1, 8.1:
    Added missing requirement that overriding methods
    have same number of required parameters
    and all optional parameters as overridden method,
    in same order. </li>
  <li> 9:
    Added prohibition against cyclic type hierarchy for type parameters. </li>
  <li> 10.10:
    Clarified requirements on use of parameterized types
    in instance creation expressions. </li>
  <li> 10.13.2:
    Added requirement that <em>q<sub>i</sub></em> are distinct. </li>
  <li> 10.14.2:
    Static method invocation determines the function
    (which may involve evaluating a getter)
    before evaluating the arguments,
    so that static invocation and top-level function invocation agree. </li>
  <li> 10.30:
    Added missing test that type being tested against
    is in scope and is indeed a type. </li>
  <li> 11.5.1:
    Changed for loop to introduce fresh variable for each iteration. </li>
  <li> 13.8:
    Malformed parameterized types generate warnings, not errors
    (except when used in reified contexts
    like instance creation and superclasses/interfaces). </li>
</ul>
