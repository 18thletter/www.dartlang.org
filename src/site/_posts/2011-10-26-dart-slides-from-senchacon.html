<p>
  I recently presented <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/slides/2011/10/senchacon/index.html#26">Building Modern Apps with HTML5 and DART</a> at SenchaCon. The Dart section begins with <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/slides/2011/10/senchacon/index.html#26">slide 26</a> and illustrates some of the ways in which Dart facilitates the building of large-scale applications while retaining the lightweight feel of a scripting language. Click on the Dart code samples to see highlighting of various language features.

  We'll be adding more presentations at <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/slides/">www.dartlang.org/slides/</a> soon.
