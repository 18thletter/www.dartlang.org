<p>
Happy Holidays, everyone!
</p>

<p>
In a fit of festive holiday cheer, we have decided to give you all an exciting present.
No, it's not a pony. No, it's not a Nintendo either. No, it's... look just stop asking and we'll tell
you. We revamped the <a href="http://api.dartlang.org">Dart API docs</a>. They're using the
new dartdoc tool which you can also use
to generate docs for your Dart code. Actually, after the whole pony and Nintendo thing, that
kind of sounds like a let down.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, we've got <a href="http://api.dartlang.org">brand new docs up</a>, including the
new <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/html.html">dart:html library</a>. Enjoy!
</p>
