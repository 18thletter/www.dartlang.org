<section class="overview">

<p>
This page tells you how to get and use
a Chromium-based browser (nicknamed <em>Dartium</em>)
that includes the Dart virtual machine (VM).
This browser can execute Dart web apps directly,
so you don't have to compile your code to JavaScript
until you're ready to test on other browsers.
</p>

<aside class="warning">
<b>Important:</b>
This browser is a technical preview,
and it might have security and stability issues.

<blockquote>
<b>Do not use Dartium as your primary browser!</b>

<section id="download">
<h2> Downloading and installing the browser </h2>

<p>
If you have an up-to-date version of
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/index.html">Dart Editor</a>,
you already have Dartium.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have Dart Editor
or want a different version of Dartium,
download the Dartium ZIP file for your platform:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/dartium-win.zip">Dartium for Windows</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/dartium-lucid64.zip">Dartium for Linux</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/dartium-mac.zip">Dartium for Mac</a> </li>
</ul>

<br>
<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The Dartium binary <b>will expire</b> after a few days.
When that happens,
you'll need to download a new copy
if you want to continue using Dartium.
</aside>

<p>
You don't usually need to do anything special to install Dartium:
just unarchive the ZIP file.
If you want Dart Editor to launch a particular copy of Dartium,
then put that copy inside
the <b>dart-sdk</b> directory of your
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/index.html">Dart Editor
installation directory</a>,
replacing the original copy of Chromium.
</p>

</section>


<section id="launch">
<h2> Launching the browser </h2>

<p>
To launch Dartium, navigate to its directory in your finder,
and double-click the blue logo labeled Chromium.
Or use
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/">Dart Editor</a>
or the <a href="#command">command line</a>.
</p>

<p>
If launching fails and you're using 64-bit Linux,
you probably need to install 32-bit libraries.
See <a href="http://dartbug.com/2052">bug #2052</a>
for details and tips.
</aside>

</p>

<aside class="note">
<b>If you already use Chromium:</b>
If another version of Chromium is open,
then you could have a profile conflict.
To avoid this, you can open Dartium or Chromium
from the command line with the
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory">--user-data-dir flag</a>.
</aside>

</section>


<section id="bug">
<h2> Filing bugs </h2>

<p>
If you find a bug in Dartium,
create an issue in the Dart project
and use the Dartium bug template:
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20for%20Dartium">File a bug against Dartium</a>
</blockquote>

</section>


<section id="detect">
<h2> Detecting Dart support </h2>

<p>
Your Dart code will work in Dartium
without any additional JavaScript code.
However, you have the option of using JavaScript code
to test whether the current browser supports Dart.
To do so,
look for the function <b>webkitStartDart</b>
on the window.navigator object.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
if (!navigator.webkitStartDart) {
  // No native Dart support.
  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function (e) {
      // ...Fall back to compiled JS...
    }
  }, false);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

</section>


<section id="command">
<h2> Launching from the command line </h2>

<p>
Because Dartium is based on Chromium, all
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags">Chromium flags</a>
should work.
In some cases, you might want to specify Dart-specific flags
so that you can tweak the embedded Dart VM’s behavior.
For example, while developing your web app,
you might want the VM to perform as many checks as possible.
To achieve that, you can enable checked mode
(the VM’s --enable_type_checks flag)
and assertion checks (--enable_asserts flag).
</p>

<p>
On Linux, you can specify flags by starting Dartium as follows:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
DART_FLAGS='--enable_type_checks --enable_asserts' <em>path</em>/chrome
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
On the Mac:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
DART_FLAGS='--enable_type_checks --enable_asserts'              \
  <em>path</em>/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Or (also on the Mac):
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
DART_FLAG='--enable_type_checks --enable_asserts'               \
   <b>open</b> <em>path</em>/Chromium.app
{% endpretty_code %}

<br>
<aside class="note">
<b>Tip:</b>
You can see the command-line flags and executable path
of your current Chromium-based browser
by going to <b>chrome://version</b>.
