<p>
  The Dart plugin for Eclipse
  provides much of the functionality of Dart Editor
  within your existing Eclipse installation.
  The Eclipse plugin is not supported on Windows.
  <strong>Do not use the Eclipse plugin on Windows.</strong>
  To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development,
  see <a href="/tools/">Tools for Dart</a>.

<aside class="alert alert-info">
  <b>Note:</b>
  Your version of Eclipse must be <b>3.7 or higher</b>.

<h2 id="download"> Getting and installing the Dart plugin </h2>

<p>
  In Eclipse, choose <b>Help > Install new software...</b>
  and add this URL:
</p>

<blockquote><b>http://www.dartlang.org/eclipse/update/channels/stable/</b></blockquote>

<aside class="alert alert-info">
<b>Important:</b> Click <b>OK</b> if, when you're installing this plugin,
  you see a security dialog that states,
  "Warning: You are installing software that contains unsigned content.
  The authenticity or validity of this software cannot be established.
  Do you want to continue with this installation?"<br><br>
  This warning occurs because the Eclipse plugin is not signed.
</aside>

<p>
  Want to get new features a few weeks earlier than
  users on the stable channel? Try the dev channel:
  http://www.dartlang.org/eclipse/update/channels/dev/
</p>

<p>
  After Eclipse installs the plugin and downloads the latest SDK,
  restart Eclipse.
</p>


<h2 id="setup"> Getting Dartium </h2>

<p>
  To run and debug Dart applications natively,
  you must install a copy of
  <a href="/tools/dartium/">Dartium</a> (a Chromium build with a Dart VM)
  into Eclipse.
  The Dartium executable expires within 12 weeks, and a new stable version
  of Dart is released approximately every 6 weeks,
  so you should update Dartium, the plugin, and the SDK periodically.
</p>

<p>
  To install or update Dartium,
  first open the <b>Preferences</b> dialog and
  go to the <b>Dart &gt; SDK</b> page.
  Its Dartium section tells you:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Whether Dartium is currently installed</li>
    <li>Where to install Dartium</li>
    <li>The URL where you can download Dartium
      (<a href="/tools/dartium/">dartlang.org/tools/dartium/</a>)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="sdk"> Updating the SDK </h2>

<p>
  Every time you update Dartium or the Dart plugin,
  you should also update the Dart SDK.
</p>

<p>
  To update, go to the <b>Preferences</b> dialog's
  <b>Dart &gt; SDK</b> page,
  and click the <b>Upgrade SDK</b> button.
  That page also shows current version of the SDK that's installed.
</p>


<h2 id="bugs"> Filing bugs and feature requests </h2>

<p>
  To see existing issues or create a new one,
  go to the
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=Editor%3DPlugin">plugin issue list</a>.
  Because the plugin shares much of its code with
  <a href="/tools/editor/">Dart Editor</a>,
  you might also want to check
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=label%3AArea-Editor">Dart Editor issues</a>.
