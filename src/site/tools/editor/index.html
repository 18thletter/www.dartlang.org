  Dart Editor can automatically update itself,
  along with the SDK and Dartium,
  whenever a new integration build is available.
  To enable automatic updates,
  go to <b>Preferences</b>, choose <b>Update</b>, and
  select <b>Download updates automatically</b>.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd rather choose when to update,
  make sure <b>Download updates automatically</b> is not selected.

  use the <b>About Dart Editor</b> dialog
  to download and apply updates.
