Tracking server-side performance, using the [Dart VM](/tools/dart-vm/) and the
[dart:io](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart-io)
library.

Benchmark descriptions
: We are currently showing charts for the three HTTP server benchmarks
  *Hello*, *File*, and *JSON*. These benchmarks are tracked as part of the
  [ton80](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80)
  benchmarking suite. For all benchmarks, we track requests per second,
  average latency, and max latency.

  * [Hello](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is a simple HTTP server, responding with the string "world" to all requests.
  This benchmark is showing the peak requests per second, for an HTTP server
  running a single isolate.

  * [File](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is an HTTP server that responds with the content of a 100KB file. This
  benchmark is mostly bound by file I/O.

  * [JSON](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is an HTTP server that responds with the a dynamically generated JSON string,
  for each request. This benchmark reflects some REST-like APIs, where it's
  common to JSON-encode the response.



About latency
: * *Avg latency* is the average latency recorded for all requests sent. For a
  single request, latency is the time passed from initiating the request to the
  full response has been received.

  * *Max latency* is the worst latency recorded, for all requests sent. While
  the average latency is closely bound to the requests per second, max latency
  indicates the HTTP server's ability to schedule fairly under heavy load.


System setup
: The benchmarks are run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz
  processor running the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 operating system.
  While the code runs on a 64-bit operating system, weâ€™re
  running the 32-bit version of the Dart VM.


Will there be more benchmarks?
: Yes. As more benchmarks become ready, we will publish more charts.
