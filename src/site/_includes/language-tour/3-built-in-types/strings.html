<p>
A Dart string is a sequence of Unicode character codes.
You can use either single or double quotes
to create a string:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var s1 = 'Single quotes work well for string literals.';
var s2 = "Double quotes work just as well.";
var s3 = 'It\'s easy to escape the string delimiter.';
var s4 = "It's even easier to just use the other string delimiter.";
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You can put the value of an expression inside a string
by using ${<em>expression</em>}.
If the expression is a variable,
you can skip the {}.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var s = 'string interpolation';

assert('Dart has $s, which is very handy.' ==
       'Dart has string interpolation, which is very handy.');
assert('That deserves all caps. ${s.toUpperCase()} is very handy!' ==
       'That deserves all caps. STRING INTERPOLATION is very handy!');
{% endhighlight %}

<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The <b>==</b> operator tests whether
two objects are equivalent.
In the case of strings,
they're equivalent
if they have the same characters.
</aside>

<p>
You can concatenate strings using
adjacent string literals:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var s = 'String ''concatenation'
        " works even over line breaks.";
assert(s == 'String concatenation works even over line breaks.');
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Another way to create a multi-line string:
use a triple quote
with either single or double quotation marks.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var s1 = '''
You can create
multi-line strings like this one.
''';

var s2 = """This is also a
multi-line string.""";
{% endhighlight %}

{% comment %}
In a multi-line string, the initial newline is NOT ignored (in Dartboard)
(and neither is the last newline).
{% endcomment %}

<p>
You can create a "raw" string
by prefixing it with @.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var s = @'In a raw string, even \n isn't special.';
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You can build a string using both raw strings and string interpolation,
thanks to concatenation:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var x = 123;
var s = @'$x' '$x' @'$x';
assert(s == @'$x123$x'); // The string has these characters: $x123$x
{% endhighlight %}

<h4> String methods </h4>

<p>
Each string literal has the type
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html">String</a>.
String has some handy methods,
including some that let you determine whether a string
starts with, ends with, or contains another string.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var fullName = 'Cuthbert Musgrave Girdlestone, III';

assert(fullName.startsWith('Cuthbert'));
assert(fullName.endsWith('III'));
assert(fullName.contains(new RegExp('Musgrave')));
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Strings are immutable objects,
which means you can create them but you can't change them.
If you look closely at the
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html">String API docs</a>,
you'll notice that none of the methods
actually changes the state of a String.
For example, the method replaceAll() returns a new String
without changing the original String.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var greetingTemplate = 'Hello, NAME!';
var greeting = greetingTemplate.replaceAll(new RegExp("NAME"), 'Bob');
assert(greeting != greetingTemplate); // greetingTemplate didn't change.
{% endhighlight %}

<h4> StringBuffer methods </h4>

<p>
To programmatically generate a string, you can use
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a>.
A StringBuffer doesn't generate a new String object
until toString() is called.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
var sb = new StringBuffer();

sb.add("Use a StringBuffer ");
sb.addAll(["for ", "efficient ", "string ", "creation "]);
sb.add("if you are ").add("building lots of strings.");

var fullString = sb.toString();

assert(fullString ==
    'Use a StringBuffer for efficient string creation '
    'if you are building lots of strings.');

sb.clear();  // All gone!
assert(sb.toString() == '');
{% endhighlight %}
