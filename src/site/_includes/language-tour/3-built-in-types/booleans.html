<p>
Dart has a formal boolean type, named <b>bool</b>.
Only two objects have type bool:
the boolean literals, <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.
</p>

<p>
When Dart expects a boolean value,
if that value isn't <b>true</b>,
then it is <b>false</b>.
Unlike in JavaScript,
values such as 1 or non-null objects are not treated as true.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider the following code:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var name = 'Bob';
if (name) {
  print("You have a name!"); // Prints in JavaScript, not in Dart.
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
In JavaScript, this code prints "You have a name!" because
<code>name</code> is a non-null object.
However, in Dart, the above doesn't print at all
because <code>name</code> is converted to <b>false</b>
because <code>name != true</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's another example of code
that behaves differently in JavaScript and Dart:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
if (1) {
  print("JavaScript prints this line because it thinks 1 is true.");
} else {
  print("Dart prints this line because it thinks 1 is NOT true.");
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<b>Note:</b>
The previous two samples work only in production mode, not checked mode.
</aside>

<p>
Dart's treatment of booleans is designed
to avoid the strange behaviors that can arise
when many values can be treated as true.
What this means for you is that,
instead of using code like
<code>if&nbsp;(<em>nonboolean_value</em>)</code>,
you should instead explicitly check for values.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
// Check for an empty string.
var fullName = '';
assert(<b>fullName.isEmpty()</b>);

// Check for zero.
var hitPoints = 0;
assert(<b>hitPoints &lt;= 0</b>);

// Check for null.
var unicorn;
assert(<b>unicorn == null</b>);

// Check for NaN.
var iMeantToDoThis = 0/0;
assert(<b>iMeantToDoThis.isNaN()</b>);
{% endpretty_code %}

{PENDING: I didn't include info on operator results
(and the resulting differences from JS/Ruby default value assignment)
because we haven't discussed operators yet.
We should be sure to cover this in the operator section!}
{QUESTION: Is this covered? If so, should we point to it from here?}
