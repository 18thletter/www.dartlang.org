<p>
Perhaps the most common collection in nearly every programming language
is the <em>array</em>, or ordered set of objects.
In Dart, arrays are List objects,
so we usually just call them <em>lists</em>.
When you compile Dart to JavaScript,
a Dart list compiles to a JavaScript array.
</p>

<p>
Dart list literals look like JavaScript array literals.
Here's a simple Dart list:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
You can get a list's length
and refer to list elements
just as you would in JavaScript:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
print(list.length); // the # of elements: 3
print(list[1]);     // the second item: 2
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
You can add an element to a list using the <b>add()</b> method:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
list.add(4);
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
To remove elements from a list
(reducing the list's size),
use the <b>removeRange()</b> method:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3,4];
list.removeRange(2, 1); // remove the third element
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
So far, we've only talked about <b>extendable</b> lists,
but you can also create lists with a <b>fixed size</b>,
using the List() constructor:
<span class="comment">{PENDING: we haven't mentioned constructors or null yet}</span>
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = new List(3); //fixed-size list (full of null values)
{% endpretty_code %}

<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Fixed-size lists don't support methods such as add() and removeRange()
that change the list's length.
</aside>

<section id="list-iterate">
<h4> Iterating </h4>

<p>
When you need to work on each element of a list,
you can use <b>for</b>, <b>for</b>...<b>in</b>, or <b>forEach()</b>.
Use <b>for</b> when you need the current iteration index:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
for (var x = 0; x &lt; list.length; x++) {
  print('$x: ${list[x]}');
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
If you don't need the index,
you can use <b>for</b>...<b>in</b>:
</p>

{% comment %}
{PENDING: should we be using final wherever possible?
I hesitated because we haven't covered final yet,
but I also hate to spread bad code.
So I left final in here but haven't gone through and used it elsewhere...}
{% endcomment %}

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
for (final x in list) {
  print(x);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
If you just want to apply a function to each element of the list,
use the <b>forEach()</b> method:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
void printElement(element) => print(element);
list.forEach(printElement);
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Or, more succintly:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
var list = [1,2,3];
list.forEach((element) => print(element));
{% endpretty_code %}

<h4> List and Collection methods </h4>

<p>
The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html#forEach">forEach()</a> method
is just one of many handy methods defined by the
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html">List</a>
interface and its superinterface,
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html">Collection</a>.
For example, 
the <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html#filter">filter()</a> method
returns a new collection with only the elements that satisfy a condition.
The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html#every">every()</a> and
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html#some">some()</a> methods
check whether a collection matches
every condition or at least one condition, respectively.
The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html#sort">sort()</a> method
lets you sort a list using any criteria you like.

<h4> Summary of lists </h4>

<p>
Lists are ordered sequences of objects.
Dart has no class or interface called Array,
but lists act extremely similar to the arrays
that many programming languages have.
To find the methods you can invoke on lists,
see the documentation for
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html">List</a>
and its superinterface,
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html">Collection</a>.
