<p>
<em>Interfaces</em>&mdash;types that define
which methods a class provides&mdash;are
important in Dart.
In fact, most of the Dart libraries are defined in terms of interfaces,
although you don't usually need to worry about this
because many library interfaces have a <em>factory class</em>&mdash;
a class that creates objects that implement the interface.
You don't need to know anything about the factory class.
You just use the interface's constructor,
which defers to the factory class's implementation of the constructor.
</p>

<p>
For example, if your code says <code>new DateTime.now()</code>,
the factory class for the <code>DateTime</code> interface
creates an object representing the current time
that implements all the methods in the <code>DateTime</code> interface.
You can find documentation on
<a href="/docs/ref/DateTime.html" target="_blank"><code>DateTime</code></a>
and other APIs in the
<a href="/docs/ref/" target="_blank">Dart Library Reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
An example that might surprise you is the relationship between
<code>num</code>,
<code>int</code>, and
<code>double</code>.
You might expect
<code>int</code> and <code>double</code> to be primitive types,
but they aren't.
Instead, they're interfaces that extend <code>num</code>.
Having the <code>num</code> type makes it easy
to deal with integer and floating-point numbers
without having to explicitly convert from one to the other.

<code class="codes">class Greeter implements Comparable {
  String prefix = 'Hello,';
  Greeter() {}
  Greeter.withPrefix(this.prefix);
  greet(String name) => print('$prefix $name');

  /* Implement the Comparable interface. */
  /** Compares the prefixes of two Greeters. */
  int compareTo(Greeter other) => prefix.compareTo(other.prefix);
}

void main() {
  Greeter greeter = new Greeter();
  Greeter greeter2 = new Greeter.withPrefix('Hi,');

  num result = greeter2.compareTo(greeter);
  if (result == 0) {
    greeter2.greet('you are the same.');
  } else {
    greeter2.greet('you are different.');
  }
}
