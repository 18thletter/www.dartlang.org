<em>Interfaces</em>&mdash;types that define
which methods a class provides&mdash;are
important in Dart.
In fact, much of the Dart
<a href="/docs/api/" target="_blank">core library</a>
is defined in terms of interfaces.
If you've never used a language
that features interfaces or protocols,
you might want to

<code class="codes">class Greeter implements Comparable {

  int compareTo(Greeter other) => prefix.compareTo(other.prefix);

<h3> About the code </h3>

<p>
The preceding code both uses and implements interfaces.
Here's what's interesting about it:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Interface implementation </dt>
  <dd>
    The <code>Greeter</code> class implements the core libary's
    <a href="/docs/api/Comparable.html" target="_blank"><code>Comparable</code></a>
    interface,
    making it easy to compare two <code>Greeter</code> objects.
    Implementing the interface consists of two steps:
    adding <code>implements Comparable</code>
    to the <code>class</code> statement (line 1),
    and adding a definition of the only method required
    by <code>Comparable</code>: <code>compareTo()</code>
    (line 7).
  </dd>

  <dt> <code>int</code> and <code>num</code> interfaces </dt>
  <dd>
    Although you might expect <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>
    to be primitive types,
    they're actually interfaces that
    extend the <code>num</code> interface.
    This means that <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> variables
    are also <code>num</code>s.

<aside class="note">
<b>Important:</b>
Be sure to initialize numbers.
Because they're objects,
their initial value is <code>null</code>,
not 0.
</aside>

    <p>
    In use, <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>
    feel like the primitive types you're probably used to.
    For example, you can use literals to set their values:
    </p>

<pre>int height = 160;
double rad = 0.0;</pre>
  </dd>

<h3> More about interfaces </h3>

<p>
In Dart, you can often create objects directly from an interface,
instead of having to find a class that implements that interface.
This is possible because
many interfaces have a <em>factory class</em>&mdash;a
class that creates objects that implement the interface.
For example, if your code says <code>new Date.now()</code>,
the factory class for the
<a href="/docs/api/Date.html" target="_blank"><code>Date</code></a>
interface creates an object
that represents the current time.
