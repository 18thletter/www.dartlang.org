The Dart code below
is inside the Dartboard app.
If you click the Run button
at Dartboard's upper left&mdash;go
ahead, you know you want to&mdash;you'll
see the expected output (Hello, World!)
at the bottom.
</p>

<code class="codes">main() {
  var name = 'World';
  print('Hello, ${name}!');
} </code>

<h3> About the code </h3>

<p>
This example illustrates some basic Dart features and conventions:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Top-level <code>main()</code> function </dt>
  <dd>
    Having a <code>main()</code> function with no surrounding class
    lets Dart know where to start executing your code.
  </dd>

  <dt> Variable declared with <code>var</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    Whenever you create a variable in a Dart program,
    you must use
    the <code>var</code> keyword,
    the <code>final</code> keyword,
    or a type name
    to declare that variable.
  </dd>

  <dt> Output with <code>print()</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    Dart's <code>print()</code> function
    sends text to the console.
  </dd>

  <dt> String literals </dt>
  <dd>
    You can use either single or double quotes to mark strings:
    <code>'World'</code> and <code>"World"</code> are equally valid.
  </dd>

  <dt> String interpolation with <code>${<em>expression</em>}</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    Dart lets you embed expressions within string literals.
    If the expression is just a variable,
    as it is in this example,
    then you can omit the curly braces (<code>{}</code>).
    Another alternative for building strings
    is the plus operator (<code>+</code>).
    For example, the following three statements are equivalent:

    <pre>print('Hello, ${name}!');
print('Hello, $name!');
print('Hello, ' + name + '!');</pre></dd> </dl>

<h3> Try this </h3>

<dl>
  <dt> Edit the code and click the Run button
    to compile and run the new code. </dt>
  <dd>
    Some changes to try:
    <ul>
      <li> Change <code>'World'</code> to some other string&mdash;maybe
        <code>'Mondo'</code> or <code>"you"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change <code>${name}</code> to <code>$name</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Embed an arithmetic expression in the output string.
        For example:
        <pre>var age = 21;
print("Happy birthday, $name, you're ${++age} today.");
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt> Save a link to your Dart code. Send it to friends! 
  <span class="comment">
  {PENDING: Is this something we want to emphasize?
  If not, delete it.}
  </span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    When you click the Run button,
    a link appears at the top of Dartboard.
    Click it to bring up a new tab or window
    that has your new code&mdash;saved for posterity&mdash;in Dartboard.
    You can share it with your friends and colleagues
    using Twitter, Google+, or any other mechanism you like.
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: recommend hashtags?
    show a picture of a G+ entry or tweet with a hashtag and
    display something funny/cool if they go to that URL?}
    </span>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3> Tips for using Dartboard </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Dartboard indicates warnings with yellow flags
    and errors with red flags. 
    Mouse over the flag to see a description of the problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you edit the code originally displayed by Dartboard,
    a Reload button appears at the top of the Dartboard.
    Click it to go back to the original code.
  </li>
  <li>
    The usual keyboard shortcuts should work in Dartboard.
    For example, in Google Chrome on a Mac ,
    Command-Z undoes your last change,
    and Shift-Command-Z re-applies it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="comment">
{PERHAPS: make each section its own tab?
"About the code", "Try this", "Tips", ...
The downside (besides it taking time :)
is that you wouldn't be able to view the content of 2 tabs at once.}
