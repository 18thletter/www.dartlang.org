<h2>Step 3: Open a sample</h2>

<p>
The Dart Editor bundle comes with several samples.
In this step, you'll open one and run it.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
    Go to the <b>File</b> menu,
    and choose <b>Open...</b>.
    Or use the keyboard shortcut
    (<b>Ctl+O</b> or, on Mac, <b>Option+O</b>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <p>
    Navigate to your Dart installation directory,
    then to <b>samples</b>,
    and then to <b>sunflower</b>.
    Double-click <b>Sunflower.dart</b>.
    </p>
</ol>

<p>
Your Dart Editor should now look something like this:
</p>

<img src="images/DartEditor-sunflower.png"
  alt="screenshot of Dart Editor displaying the Sunflower sample's code"
  width="600" height="454">

<p>
Dart Editor not only displays the contents of <code>Sunflower.dart</code>,
but also updates the Libraries view
to list important files for the sample.
This list includes the resources that <code>Sunflower.dart</code> refers to,
plus any HTML files in the Dart file's directory
that refer to the app's code,

    {NOTE about terminology: The
    <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.eclipse.org%2Findigo%2Findex.jsp">Workbench User Guide</a> says "view", so I'm using that
    since I figure that might be familiar to Eclipse users.}
{% endcomment %}
</p>

<p>
The Libraries view puts this list under a node called
<code>sunflower</code>,
corresponding to the following
line of code in <code>Sunflower.dart</code>:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
#library('sunflower');
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
The Libraries view displays entries for the Dart
<b>core</b> and <b>dom</b> libraries.
The <b>core</b> library is there because every Dart program uses it.
The <b>dom</b> library is there because of this program's
reference to it in the following statement:
</p>

<pre>#import('dart:dom');</pre>

<p>
For more information about the Sunflower example, read the
<a href="/samples/sunflower/index.html">Sunflower Code Walkthrough</a>.
</p>

</section>

<section id="run">
<h2> Step 4: Run the sample </h2>

<p>
To run any program in Dart,
just click the Run button
<img src="images/run.png" alt="Run" width="16" height="16"
  style="vertical-align:top">
while any item in that program's library is selected.
Dart Editor compiles your Dart program to JavaScript.
It then brings up a browser window that displays
the program's HTML page,
with the JavaScript version of the program running inside it.
</p>

<p>
For example, to run Sunflower,
click <b>Sunflower.dart</b>
and then the <b>Run</b> button.
</p>

<img src="images/sunflower-run.png"
  alt="Snapshot of Libraries view and Run button"
  style="border: 1px solid black"
  width="302" height="157">

<p>
In the browser window that comes up,
move the slider to display the sunflower.
It should look something like this:

<h2> Step 5: Try some Dart Editor features </h2>

<p>
This section introduces you to some of Dart Editor's features,
such as finding where APIs are declared,
outlining the contents of a Dart file,
and auto-completing references to APIs.
We expect to add many more features over time.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    In the Editor view of <code>Sunflower.dart</code>,
    select anywhere within the string <b>Math</b>
    (at the top of the <code>Sunflower()</code> constructor).
    Then either press <b>F3</b>
    or right-click and choose <b>Open Declaration</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="images/sunflower-f3.png"
      alt="screenshot of right-click on Math"
      style="border: 1px solid black"
      width="423" height="255">

    <p>
    The editor opens a new tab that displays the file that declares the
    <a href="/docs/api/Math.html"><code>Math</code></a> type.
    </p>

    <aside class="note">
    <b>Tip:</b>
    You can also use this trick to find declarations within the same file.
    </aside>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Click the left arrow button
    <img src="images/leftarrow.png" alt="left arrow" width="16" height="16"
      style="vertical-align:top">
    (to the left of the Run button)
    to go back to <code>Sunflower.dart</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Either press <b>Alt+O</b> (<b>Option+O</b> on Mac) or
    right-click and choose <b>Quick Outline</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    A panel comes up displaying
    the classes, methods, and fields
    declared in <code>Sunflower.dart</code>.
    It looks something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="images/sunflower-outline.png"
      alt="screenshot of outline panel"
      width="383" height="339">

    <br>
    You can reduce the size of the list
    by typing one or more characters.
    For example, if you type <b>x</b>,
    only the <b>xc</b> variable appears.

    <p>
    Choose an item from the list&mdash;for example, <b>xc</b>.
    You'll be taken to its declaration in <code>Sunflower.dart</code>.
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Now it's time to use Dart Editor's auto-complete feature.
    </p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li> <p>
        Find the declaration of <b>TAU</b>,
        near the end of <code>Sunflower.dart</code>:
        </p>
{% pretty_code %}
static final TAU = Math.PI * 2;
{% endpretty_code %}
        </li>
      <li> <p>
        Delete everything to the right of <code>Math</code>,
        and then type a period (<b>.</b>).
        After a short pause,
        a list of autocomplete suggestions comes up,
        looking something like this:
        </p>

        <img src="images/sunflower-dotcomplete.png"
          alt="snapshot of autocomplete for Math."
          style="border: 1px solid black"
          width="450" height="234">
        </p> </li>
      <li> <p>
        Type or use the arrow keys to select <code>PI</code>,
        and then press Enter or Return to dismiss the panel.
        </p> </li>
      <li> <p>
        Complete your changes&mdash;for
        example, if you think sunflower seeds should be semi-circular,
        use <code>Math.PI</code> instead of <code>Math.PI*2</code>&mdash;and
        then save the file.
        </p>

        <p>
        If Dart Editor displays an error after you save,
        you've made a syntax error.
        Fix it or undo your typing,
        and then save again.
        </p> </li>
      <li> <p>
        Click the <b>Run</b> button to run your changed
        version.
        </p> </li>
      <li> <p>
        Back in Dart Editor,
        edit the Dart code again.
        This time use <b>Ctl+Space</b>
        to bring up the auto-complete suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example, type <code>Mat</code>, then Ctl+Space
        to see a list of classes and interfaces
        that start with "Mat".
        </p> </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Step 6: Create a new web app </h2>

<p>
Now that you're familiar with Dart Editor,
you can create a web app from scratch.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
    Click the New Application
    <img src="images/newapp.png" alt="New App" width="16" height="16"
     style="vertical-align:top"> button
    (at the upper left of Dart Editor)
    to create a new app.
    Alternatively, choose <b>File > New Application...</b>
    from the Dart Editor menu.
    </p>

    <p>
    A dialog comes up, looking something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="images/DartEditor-newapp.png"
      alt="screenshot of the New Application dialog"
      width="538" height="304">
    </li>
  <li> <p>
    Type in a name for your application&mdash;for
    example, <code>HelloWorld</code>.
    If you don't like the default directory,
    type in a new location or browse to choose the location.
    Click <b>Finish</b> to create the initial files for the app.
    </p>

    <p>
    A default Dart file appears in the Edit view,
    and a few additional items appear
    in the Libraries view.
    Your Dart Editor window should look something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="images/DartEditor-helloworld.png"
      alt="screenshot of Dart Editor just after New Application..."
      width="599" height="454" >

    </li>
  <li> <p>
    Click the
    <img src="images/run.png" alt="Run" width="16" height="16"
     style="vertical-align:top">
    button to run your new app.
    </p> </li>
  <li> <p>
    View the HTML file in Dart Editor
    by double-clicking it in the Libraries view.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that the HTML file's &lt;script> tag
    refers to a file that ends with
    <code>.dart.app.js</code>.
    You can't see this file in Dart Editor,
    but this JavaScript file is automatically created
    from your Dart code.
    Compiling to JavaScript allows browsers that know nothing about Dart
    to execute your app.
    </p>

    <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b>
    The generated JavaScript is rather huge right now.
    Don't worry, we'll fix that.
    </aside>

    {% comment %}
    {PENDING: update when JS production is better.}
    {% endcomment %}
    </p> </li>
  <li> <p>
    Modify the default Dart and HTML files as you like,
    using auto-completion,
    <a href="/samples/index.html">samples</a>, and 
    <a href="/docs/api/index.html">API reference documentation</a>
    to figure out which APIs you can use.
