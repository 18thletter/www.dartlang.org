  <p>
    Dart is a new language for scalable, structured web programming.
    Take a look and
    <a href="#">tell us what you think</a>.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt> From quick prototypes to serious apps </dt>
    <dd> Dart's optional types let you prototype quickly
      and then revise your code to be more maintainable.
    </dd>
    <dt> Wherever you need structured code </dt>
    <dd> You can use the same Dart code both in modern web browsers* and on servers.
    </dd>
    <dt> Familiar yet new </dt>
    <dd> Dart code should look familiar if you know a language or two,
      and you can use time-tested features such as classes and closures.
      Dart's new features&mdash;such as
      optional typing&mdash;make
      it easier for you to develop and maintain software.
    </dd>
    <dt> Tools included </dt>
    <dd> The Dart SDK includes the Dart Editor,
       a VM, core libraries, and more.
    </dd>

  <h2>An example of Dart code</h2>

{PENDING: Maybe this shouldn't be runnable, and we should just point people to a new Getting Started page that features DartBoard.
 Experiments like: converting something from untyped to typed.}

//PENDING: Show something that's a mix of Java and JavaScript.
//Make it shortish and familiar, yet intriguingly different.
//E.g.: real class/types + event listener. "class" should be there.
//optional typing, event listener.
//Use the DOM if we can. (Can we?) But not if it looks much worse than jquery.
//Dan (et al) to think about this.
//Show all "unusual features" mentioned in the "Familiar yet new" item above.
