    Dart is a new language for scalable, structured web programming.
    Take a look and
    <a href="#">tell us what you think</a>.

  <dl>
    <dt> From quick prototypes to serious apps </dt>
    <dd> Dart's optional types let you prototype quickly
      and then revise your code to be more maintainable.
    </dd>
    <dt> Wherever you need structured code </dt>
    <dd> You can use the same Dart code both in modern web browsers* and on servers.
    </dd>
    <dt> Familiar yet new </dt>
    <dd> Dart code should look familiar if you know a language or two,
      and you can use time-tested features such as classes and closures.
      Dart's new features make
      it easier for you to develop and maintain software.

  <h2>An example of Dart code</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
class Point  {
  var x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  scale(factor) => new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  distance() => Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);

<h2> TO DO </h2>

<ol>
  <li> Fix Home page nav?
    (The "Home" link should become a not-link when you're already on the homepage) </li>
  <li> Check links.
    BEWARE: Links to directories that don't end with /
    work on localhost but not when hosted. </li>
  <li> Fix CSS formatting. Known problems:
    <ul>
      <li> Too much space before and after &lt;pre> blocks.
        This problem is visible in several pages, including
        <a href="/articles/optional-types/#generics">Optional Types</a> and
        <a href="/docs/getting-started/interface.html">Interfaces</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
