Dart is a great fit for server applications.
For example, Dart provides support for
[futures](/docs/tutorials/futures) in the core
[async](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:asy
nc)
library, a robust [stream API](/docs/tutorials/streams), and
[WebSockets](/samples/websockets/).

### Where can I find more information about writing server code in Dart?

Get started with [tutorials](/docs/tutorials), [articles](/articles/),
and other documentation. Once you're coding, consult the
