<p>The spirodraw sample is similar to sunflower and illustrates a few more language features.</p>

Multiple source files
requestAnimationFrame
function defined outside class

In addition, the ColorPicker illustrates the use of 

typedef
type inference
initializer shortcut
terse function syntax
for ... in syntax
string interpolation

<h2>Multiple source files</h2>
<p>First, let's take a look at the spirodraw declarations.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart linenums">
#library('spirodraw');

#import('dart:dom');
#source("ColorPicker.dart");
#resource("spirodraw.css");</pre>

<p>A Dart script belongs to a libary declared with a name given by the #library directive.
Dart scripts include other scripts using the #source directive and include other libraries
with the #import directive. The #resource directive is currently not required, but ...
The arguments to the import, source, and resource directives are URLs.</p>

<p>The spirodraw sample defines a library named 'spirodraw', which includes Spirodraw.dart,
ColorPicker.dart, and the built-in Dart DOM library.</p>
