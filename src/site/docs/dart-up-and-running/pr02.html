<p>You don’t need to be an expert web developer to build web apps. With
  Dart, you can be productive as you build high-performance apps for the
  modern web.</p><p>Our aim for this book is to be a useful introduction to the Dart
  language, libraries, and tools. Because this book is short and Dart is
  young, you might also need to refer to the Dart website at <a class="ulink" href="http://dartlang.org">http://dartlang.org</a>—both for details and for updates. For the
  latest news, keep an eye on <a class="ulink" href="http://news.dartlang.org">http://news.dartlang.org</a>
  and the <a class="ulink" href="http://plus.google.com/109866369054280216564">Dart
  page</a> on Google+.</p><p>Another important website is this book’s <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-up-and-running-book">GitHub

We
    hope we haven’t forgotten anyone, but we probably have.</p><p>The following Dart engineers and managers gave us prompt, helpful
    reviews of the sections corresponding to their areas of responsibility:
    Mads Ager, Peter von der Ahé, Justin Fagnani, Dan Grove, Florian Loitsch,
    Sam McCall, Vijay Menon, John Messerly, Anton Muhin, Lasse R.H. Nielsen,
    Bob Nystrom, Ivan Posva, and Jaime Wren.</p><p>We’d especially like to thank the people who reviewed even bigger
    swaths of the book or contributed in other, large ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>JJ Behrens, whose careful look at the first draft of the book
        helped us catch errors and inconsistencies, as well as rework Chapter
        5 to be more interesting, and less of a laundry list. He also created
        a system for testing our samples, so we can be sure that they work now
        and continue to work as the language and libraries evolve.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Shailen Tuli, who helped test our examples, although he doesn’t
        even work for Google.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Mary Campione, whose stream-of-consciousness review of the
        entire book, performed while she was first learning the language,
        helped us find and fix many confusing spots, as well as some
        errors.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Phil Quitslund, who did a big-picture review of the book and
        gave us guidance and encouragement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Kasper Lund, whose review caught issues that only someone with
        his expert, comprehensive knowledge of the Dart language and libraries
        could have found.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Gilad Bracha, the language spec writer whose reviews of the
        language chapter (our longest one) were invaluable for getting
        language details right. We couldn’t cover everything, so we look
        forward to his future work on making all the corners of the language
        understandable to all Dart programmers.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other Googlers helped, as well. Vivian Li, the head of Chrome
    Developer Relations, supported our work on this book. Andres Ferrate, the
    Google Press liaison to O’Reilly, helped simplify the process of getting
    the book published. Myisha Harris gave us excellent legal advice.</p><p>The people at O’Reilly were extremely helpful. Meghan Blanchette,
    our editor, kept everything going smoothly, monitoring our progress in the
    nicest possible way. We’d also like to thank the good people who manage
    the author workflow and make working on an O’Reilly book such a pleasure.
    We personally worked with Sarah Schneider and Jessica Hosman.</p><p>Finally, we thank Lars Bak and Kasper Lund for writing the foreword,
    and most of all for creating Dart.</p>
