<h2> Getting the SDK </h2>

<p>
If you have an up-to-date version of
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/">Dart Editor</a>,
you already have the SDK. Look for a dart-sdk directory
inside of the Dart Editor directory.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have Dart Editor
or want a different version of the SDK,
download the ZIP file for your platform's SDK:

{% include downloads/_sdk.html %}

<p>
Or live dangerously: download the
<span class="win"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-win32.zip">latest, untested build of the Windows SDK</a>.</span>
<span class="mac"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-macos.zip">latest, untested build of the Mac SDK</a>.</span>
<span class="linux"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-linux.zip">latest, untested build of the Linux SDK</a>.</span>
These continuous builds usually are updated daily.
</p>

<p>
After you download and unpack the SDK,
you'll have a directory named <code>dart-sdk</code>.
You'll see a <code>bin</code> directory for the command-line tools,
and a <code>lib</code> directory for the Dart libraries.
</p>
