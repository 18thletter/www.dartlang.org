## Dart is familiar
Dart is a class-based,
object-oriented language with lexical scoping,
closures, and optional static typing.
Dart helps you build structured modern web apps
and is easy to learn for a wide range of developers.

## Dart makes you more productive
Dart Editor and the SDK provide an integrated
development and debugging experience.
The editor supports refactoring, breakpoints,
code completion, code navigation, and more.
The SDK contains the stand-alone virtual machine,
a package manager, and Chromium with an embedded Dart VM.

## Dart web apps run in all modern browsers.
Dart can be compiled to JavaScript,
so you can use it for web apps in all modern desktop and mobile browsers.
Our JavaScript compiler generates minimal code
thanks to tree-shaking.
Dart apps can also run on the server,
in a stand-alone Dart VM.
