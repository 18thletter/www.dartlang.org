<h1> Getting Started:<br> Hello, Command Line </h1>

<p>
Follow this tutorial on a Linux or Mac OS system
to write and run a Spot program
using command-line tools.
</p>

<aside>
<b>Only have Windows?</b>
Sorry, there's no command-line interface yet.
You can use the IDE instead, as described in
<a href="index.html">Getting Started: Hello, World</a>.

<h2 id="download"> Step 1: Download and install the Spot bundle </h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download the Spot bundle:

    <p class="comment">
    {PENDING: big download button goes here; same code as homepage buttons?}
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Unzip the bundle by double-clicking it in a file viewer
    or by executing a command in a shell window:

<pre>
mv spot.zip ~/bin
unzip spot.zip
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    Note the location of the <code>spot_bin</code>
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: check tool name}</span>
    executable file.
    For convenience, create a shortcut to it
    or add its directory to your path.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The Spot bundle contains tools such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A <em>compiler</em> that translates Spot to JavaScript </li>
  <li> An Eclipse-based <em>integrated development environment</em>
    (<em>IDE</em>) </li>
  <li> A <em>virtual machine</em> (<em>VM</em>),
       which you can use to run Spot code
       without first translating it to JavaScript </li>
</ul>

<aside>
<b>Note:</b>
This tutorial uses only the virtual machine from the bundle,
to keep things simple.
Unfortunately, the Spot VM only works on Linux and Mac OS, for now.

<h2 id="code"> Step 2: Create a Spot program </h2>

<p>
Create a file named <code>hello.spot</code>
that contains the following code:
</p>

<pre>
class HelloWorld {
  static void main(arguments) {
    Logger.println("Hello, World");
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
This program illustrates a few things about Spot
that are different from JavaScript:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Spot is <b>object oriented</b>.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    As a rule, Spot source code has <em>methods</em> in <em>classes</em>,
    instead of functions.
    In <code>hello.spot</code>,
    the <code>HelloWorld</code> class
    has one method, named <code>main()</code>.

    <aside>
    <b>Note:</b>
    If you aren't familiar with object-oriented concepts
    such as classes, methods, and instances,
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: help them find a good reference}</span>.
    </aside>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    Spot lets you use <b>types</b>&mdash;but you don't have to.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    In <code>hello.spot</code>,
    the <code>main()</code> method has the type <code>void</code>,
    indicating that the method doesn't return a value.
    However, the <code>arguments</code> parameter has no type
    (although it could).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Spot source filenames end in <b><code>.spot</code></b>.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This tutorial features a Spot source file,
    but you can also embed Spot code in HTML files.
    An example of embedding Spot code is in
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: some example;
    point to an explanation if/when we have one}</span>.

Now that you have a program, run it in the Spot VM:
