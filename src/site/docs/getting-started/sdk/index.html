This page tells you how to find and use
prerelease versions of the Dart SDK on
<span class="linux">Linux.</span>

<span class="win">Windows.</span>
<br>
(These instructions are available for

The SDK includes the following tools:

  <li> Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (dart2js)</li>
  <li> Dart VM </li>
  <li> Dart libraries </li>
</ul>

<h2> Getting the SDK </h2>

<p>
If you have an up-to-date version of
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/">Dart Editor</a>,
you already have the SDK.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have Dart Editor
or want a different version of the SDK,
download the ZIP file for your platform's SDK:

{% include downloads/_sdk.html %}

<p>
Or live dangerously: download the
<span class="win"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-win32.zip">latest, untested build of the Windows SDK</a>.</span>
<span class="mac"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-macos.zip">latest, untested build of the Mac SDK</a>.</span>
<span class="linux"><a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-linux.zip">latest, untested build of the Linux SDK</a>.</span>
These continuous builds usually are updated daily.
</p>

<p>
After you download and unpack the SDK,
you'll have a directory named <code>dart-sdk</code>.
Its <code>bin</code> directory has
<code>dart2js</code> (the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler) and
<code>dart</code> (the Dart VM).
</p>

</section>


<section id="dart2js">
<h2>Using dart2js</h2>

<p>
To compile a Dart file to JavaScript, use <code>bin/dart2js</code>.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart2js test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This command produces a <code>.js</code> file
that contains the JavaScript equivalent of your Dart code.
</p>

<p>
Common command-line options for dart2js include:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>-o &lt;file&gt;</dt>
<dd>Generate the output into &lt;file&gt;</dd>

<dt>-c</dt>
<dd>Insert runtime type checks and enable assertions (checked mode).</dd>

<dt>-h</dt>
<dd>Display this message (add -v for information about all options).</dd>
</dl>

<aside class="note">
<b>What happened to frog?</b>
frog was a previous version of a Dart-to-JavaScript
compiler. It has been deprecated and replaced by dart2js.

<section id="vm">
<h2>Using the VM</h2>

<p>
To run a Dart file in the Dart VM, use <code>bin/dart</code>.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Print all the command-line options with <code>--print-flags</code>:
</p>

{% pc console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --print-flags Test
{% endpc %}

<p>
That third argument is required for now, until we fix
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2837">bug #2837</a>.
</p>

<h3>Enabling type checks</h3>

<p>
  Dart programs run in one of two modes: checked or production.
  In checked mode, assignments are dynamically checked, and
  certain violations of the type system raise exceptions at run time.
  In production mode, static type annotations have no
  effect.
</p>

<p>
  During development, we recommend using checked mode. You can
  run the VM in checked mode with a command-line flag:

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --enable_type_checks test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}
</p>

<h3>Enabling assertions</h3>

<p>
  An assertion checks a boolean condition and, if false, raises an exception.
  The <code>assert()</code> statements do not run in production mode.
  We recommend that you enable assertions during development.
</p>

<p>
  You can enable assertions in the VM with a command-line flag:

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --enable_asserts test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}
</p>
