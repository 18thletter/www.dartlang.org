<p>
This page tells you how to find and use
prerelease versions of the Dart SDK.
The SDK includes the following tools:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (aka <em>frog</em>)</li>
  <li> Dart VM </li>
  <li> Dart libraries </li>
</ul>

<p>
For more information about the SDK, see the blog post
<a href="http://blog.sethladd.com/2012/01/dart-sdk-quick-tour.html">Dart SDK Quick Tour</a>.
</p>

<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The SDK is in very early days, and it might not always work.
If you just want to play with Dart, try
<a href="/docs/getting-started/index.html">Dartboard</a>.
For a real development environment, use
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/index.html">Dart Editor</a>.

<h2> Getting the SDK </h2>

<p>
If you have an up-to-date version of
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/index.html">Dart Editor</a>,
you already have the SDK.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have Dart Editor
or want a different version of the SDK,
download the SDK ZIP file for your platform:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/dart-win32.zip">Windows SDK</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/dart-macos.zip">Mac SDK</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/dart-linux.zip">Linux SDK</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Or live dangerously: download the latest, untested build of the SDK.
These continuous builds are updated at least daily,
and sometimes much more often.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-win32.zip">Windows SDK (latest)</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-macos.zip">Mac SDK (latest)</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/latest/dart-linux.zip">Linux SDK (latest)</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
After you download and unzip the SDK,
you'll have a directory named <code>dart-sdk</code>.
Its <code>bin</code> directory has
<code>frogc</code> (the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler) and
<code>dart</code> (the Dart VM).
</p>

</section>


<section id="frog">
<h2>Using frog</h2>

<p>
To compile a Dart file to JavaScript, use <code>bin/frogc</code>.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/frogc test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This command produces a <code>.js</code> file
that contains the JavaScript equivalent of your Dart code.
</p>

</section>


<section id="vm">
<h2>Using the VM</h2>

<p>
To run a Dart file in the Dart VM, use <code>bin/dart</code>.
For example:
</p>

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Print all the command-line options with <code>--print-flags</code>:
</p>

{% pc console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --print-flags Test
{% endpc %}

<p>
That third argument is required for now, until we fix
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2837">bug #2837</a>.
</p>

<h3>Enabling type checks</h3>

<p>
  Dart programs run in one of two modes: checked or production.
  In checked mode, assignments are dynamically checked, and
  certain violations of the type system raise exceptions at run time.
  In production mode, static type annotations have no
  effect.
</p>

<p>
  During development, we recommend using checked mode. You can
  run in checked mode with a command-line flag:

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --enable_type_checks test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}
</p>

<h3>Enabling assertions</h3>

<p>
  An assertion checks a boolean condition and, if false, raises an exception.
  The <code>assert()</code> statements do not run in production mode.
  We recommend that you enable assertions during development.
</p>

<p>
  You can enable assertions with a command-line flag:

{% pretty_code console 0 %}
$DART_SDK/bin/dart --enable_asserts test.dart
{% endpretty_code %}
</p>
