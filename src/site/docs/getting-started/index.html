<h1> Getting Started: Hello, DartBoard </h1>

<p>
Follow this tutorial
to write and run small Dart programs
inside this browser window,
using a tool called DartBoard.
</p>

<section>
<h2 id="1"> Sample #1: Hello, World! </h2>

<p>
If you run the following program—go ahead, you know you want to—you'll
see the expected output (Hello, World!) at the bottom of the DartBoard.
</p>

<pre style="border: black 1px solid;">
main() {
  Logger.println('Hello, World!');
}
</pre>

<p>
What's important about this sample:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    It has a <code>main()</code> method with no surrounding class.
    <br />
    This is a DartBoard convention;
    it lets DartBoard know where to start executing your code.
  </li>
  <li>
    It prints output using <code>Logger</code>.
    <br />
    Again, this is a DartBoard convention.
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: What would you do in a server app?
    If the same, say something like
    "This is a DartBoard convention that's also used
    in server-side code."}
    </span>
    In a web app, you'd use the DOM instead.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You can edit the sample if you wish.
Go ahead. We'll wait.
</p>

</section>


<section>
<h2 id="2"> Sample #2: Hello, Class! </h2>

<p>
Let's add a class to the sample.
Classes are important in Dart.
They're how you create objects,
and along with interfaces
they define all the object types in Dart programs.
<span class="comment">
{PENDING: point to a primer on object-oriented programming?}
</span>
</p>

<pre style="border: black 1px solid;">
class Greeter {
  Greeter() {}

  printGreeting(greeting) {
    Logger.println(greeting);
  }
}

main() {
  var greeter = new Greeter();
  greeter.printGreeting('Hello, Class!');
}
</pre>

<p>
What's important about the preceding code:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Uses <code>class</code> to create a class named <code>Greeter</code>
    that inherits from the root class, <code>Object</code>.
  <li> Defines a constructor, <code>Greeter()</code>
    <br>
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: why did it require this?}</span> </li>
  <li> Uses <code>var</code> before <code>greeter</code>
    <br>
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: why did it require this?}</span> </li>
  <li> Uses no types for variables and parameters
    <br>
    Types are optional in Dart.
    We left them out because we're just playing right now,
    but here's what the program might look like with types
    (the new types are <b>bold</b>):
    <span class="comment">
    {Note that there's no "public" keyword in Dart? That messed me up... Also, // comments don't seem to work; at least in DartBoard.}
    </span>
    
<pre>
class Greeter {
  Greeter() {}

  <b>void</b> printGreeting(<b>String</b> greeting) {
    Logger.println(greeting);
  }
}

<b>void</b> main() {
  <b>Greeter</b> greeter = new Greeter();
  greeter.printGreeting('Hello, Types!');
}
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="3"> Sample #3: Hello, Class! </h2>

<p class="comment">
{PENDING... go on. What else do we want to show in DartBoard?
Implementing an interface? Using a core library? Isolates?}
</p>

<pre style="border: black 1px solid;">
class App implements Runnable {
  App() {}

  void run(ReceivePort port) {
    Logger.println('Hey, this is App.run.');
  }
}

void main() {
  Isolate.start(new App(), function(SendPort port) {
    Logger.println('Hey, this is main.');
  });
}
</pre>

which will walk you through downloading the Dart bundle
and using the Dart Editor to create an app.
