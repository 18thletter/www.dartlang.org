<h2 id="1"> Sample #1: Hello, World! </h2>

<p>
Below this paragraph, you can see some Dart code
inside of an app called Dart Board.
If you click Dart Board's [PLAY] button&mdash;go
ahead, you know you want to&mdash;you'll
see the expected output (Hello, World!)
appear at the bottom.
</p>

<!-- pre style="border: black 1px solid;" -->
<code class="codes">main() {
  var name = 'World';
  print('Hello, ${name}!');
} </code>

<p>
What's important about this sample's Dart code:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Top-level <code>main()</code> method </dt>
  <dd>
    Having a <code>main()</code> method with no surrounding class
    is a Dart Board convention.
    It lets Dart Board know where to start executing your code.
    In a web app, you'd use <em>directives</em> instead&mdash;little
    statements at the top of your <code>.dart</code> file.
    (Don't worry, you'll learn about directives
    in the next page.)
  </dd>

  <dt> Variable declared with <code>var</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    You must use either the <code>var</code> keyword
    or a type name
    whenever you create a variable.
  </dd>

  <dt> Output with <code>print()</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    The <code>print()</code> method is
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: another Dart Board convention?}
    </span>.
    In a web app you'd use the DOM or
    something like <code>console.log()</code> instead.
    <span class="comment">
    {QUESTION: correct?}
    </span>
  </dd>

  <dt> String interpolation with <code>${<em>expression</em>}</code> </dt>
  <dd>
    Dart lets you embed expressions within string literals.
    If the expression is just a variable,
    as it is in this sample,
    then you can omit the curly braces (<code>{}</code>).
    Another alternative for building strings
    is the plus operator (<code>+</code>).
    For example, the following three statements are equivalent
    <span class="comment"> {PENDING: are they truly equivalent,
    or do they just result in the same string?} </span>:

    <pre>print('Hello, ${name}!');
print('Hello, $name!');
print('Hello, ', + name + '!');</pre> </dl>

<p>
You can edit the sample if you like.
Go ahead. We'll wait.
</p>

<section>
<h2 id="2"> Sample #2: Hello, Class! </h2>

<p>
The next sample adds a class to the previous code.
Classes are important in Dart.
They're how you create objects,
and along with interfaces
they define all the object types in Dart programs.
<span class="comment">
{PENDING: correct?
should we point to a primer on object-oriented programming?
if so, which one?}
</span>
</p>


<!-- pre style="border: black 1px solid;" -->
<code class="codes">class Greeter {
  var prefix = "Hello, ";

  Greeter() {}

  greet(name) {
    print('$prefix$name');
  }
}

main() {
  var greeter = new Greeter();
  greeter.greet('Class!');
} </code>

<p>
What's important about the preceding code:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <code>class</code> statement </dt>
  <dd>
    This sample defines a class, named <code>Greeter</code>,
    that has the default superclass: <code>Object</code>.
    In Dart, all classes descend from <code>Object</code>,
    either directly or indirectly.
    Use the <code>extends</code> keyword
    if you want to specify a non-<code>Object</code> superclass.
  </dd>

  <dt> Instance variable </dt>
  <dd>
    Each <code>Greeter</code> object
    has a variable named <code>prefix</code>
    that's initialized to "Hello, ".
    (As in JavaScript,
    Dart string literals can be delimited by either single or double quotes.)
    Just as for regular variables,
    creating instance variables requires
    using <code>var</code> or a type.

    <p>
    If you don't like the default value of <code>prefix</code>,
    you can set it to something else:
    </p>

<pre>greeter.prefix = "Howdy, ";</pre>

    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: say more setting and getting ivars?
    or at least point to where they're discussed}
    </span>
  </dd>

  <dt> Constructor </dt>
  <dd>
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: the spec says there should be a default constructor,
    but SSR doesn't work if you delete the constructor.
    }
    </span>
    You can create instances of a class
    by invoking <code>new</code> followed by
    a constructor for the class&mdash;in
    this case, <code>new Greeter()</code>.
    The <code>Greeter</code> class has a single, no-argument constructor that
    <!-- change to something like
    "There's no definition for Greeter(), so a default version is provided that" -->
    (implicitly) calls the superclass's no-argument constructor.
    The superclass of <code>Greeter</code> is <code>Object</code>,
    so the code <code>new Greeter()</code> invokes the
    <a href="/docs/ref/Object.html#Object"><code>Object()</code> constructor</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt> Instance method </dt>
  <dd>
    The <code>greet()</code> method
    defines a function that's tied to a <code>Greeter</code> object.
    For a one-line method such as <code>greet()</code>,
    you can use a special shorthand
    that features the <code>=></code> operator:

    <pre>// Equivalent of greet definition above:
greet(name) => print('$prefix$name');</pre>
    <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b>
    You currently get a warning about returning a value
    from a void function.
    Ignore it;
    the syntax is valid,
    and we expect the warning to disappear.
    </aside>
</p>
  <dd>


  <dt> No specified types </dt>
  <dd>
    Specifying types is optional in Dart.
    Types can help you write and maintain your code,
    but they don't change how Dart programs behave.
    Here's what the preceding sample looks like with types
    (as well as the other changes suggested above):
    
<!--
class Greeter {
  String prefix = "Hello, ";

  Greeter() {}

  void greet(name) => print('$prefix$name');
}

void main() {
  Greeter greeter = new Greeter();
  greeter.prefix = "Howdy, ";
  greeter.greet('types and other cool stuff.');
} 
-->

<code class="codes">class Greeter {
  <b>String</b> prefix = "Hello, ";

  Greeter() {}

  <b>void</b> greet(<b>String</b> name) => print('$prefix$name');
}

<b>void</b> main() {
  <b>Greeter</b> greeter = new Greeter();
  greeter.prefix = "Howdy, ";
  greeter.greet('types and other cool stuff.');
} </code>

    <aside class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      You might have expected to see a <code>public</code> keyword
      in the preceding code,
      but there's no such thing in Dart.
      Every type <span class="comment">{PENDING: ??}</span>
      in Dart is public unless its name
      starts with an underscore ("_").
      For example, <code>Greeter</code> is public,
      but <code>_Greeter</code> (by convention) would be private.
    </aside>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section>
<h2 id="3"> Sample #3: Hello, Interface! </h2>

<p class="comment">
{PENDING... go on. What else do we want to show in Dart Board?
Implementing an interface? Using a core library? Should use <code>num</code>.
We should show comments (and doc comments?) somewhere.}
</p>

<pre style="border: black 1px solid;">
class App implements Runnable {
  App() {}

  void run(ReceivePort port) {
    Logger.println('Hey, this is App.run.');
  }
}

void main() {
  Isolate.start(new App(), function(SendPort port) {
    Logger.println('Hey, this is main.');
  });
}
</pre>
