<h2> Step 1: Download and install the Dart bundle </h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download the Dart bundle: <a class="download-button" href="">Download</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    Unzip the bundle by double-clicking it in a file viewer
    or by executing a command in a shell window:

<pre class="commandline">
$ mv dart.zip ~/bin
$ unzip dart.zip
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>
    Note the location of the editor.
    Its filename is <b>DartEditor</b>.
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: check for all platforms.}</span>
{% comment %}
    when installation is working, update this text
{% endcomment %}
    For convenience, create a shortcut to it,
    move it to your path,
    or add its directory to your path.

<ol>
  <li>
    In the Dart Editor menus, choose <b>File > New Application</b>.
    <br>
    A dialog comes up.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Name field, type HelloWorld.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the Directory field,
    either accept the default
    or click the Browse... button and choose a new directory.
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: what is the default?
    HOW DO I RESET SO I CAN SEE THE DEFAULT USER EXPERIENCE?
    WHERE ARE THE DEFAULTS STORED?}
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <b>Finish</b> button.
    <br>
    Several items appear
    at the left of the Dart Editor,
    most importantly two files named
    <code>HelloWorld.dart</code> and
    <code>HelloWorld.html</code>.
    You can also see the contents of one of the files&mdash;most
    likely <code>HelloWorld.dart</code>&mdash;
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: check}</span>
    in the <em>file editor</em>,
    which is the main part of the Dart Editor UI.

    <p class="comment">
    {PENDING:
    Exactly what's there seems to depend on whether you've created a project already,
    and whether you've restarted Dart Editor since you have.
    (Libraries if you haven't restarted; Navigator if you have?)}
    </p>

    <p class="comment">
    {QUESTION:
    If you close the Navigator view,
    how do you get it back?
    Not even restarting brings it back.
    Moving the workspace directory (alongside DartEditor) to the trash
    might do the trick.
    However, now I see the Libraries view, not the Navigator view.
    The Navigator view was nice because it distinguished between
    projects/applications.}

    <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.eclipse.org%2Findigo%2Findex.jsp">Workbench User Guide</a>
    for terminology Eclipse users might be familiar with.}
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't already see the code for <code>HelloWorld.dart</code>,
    go to the Libraries view
    and double-click <b>HelloWorld.dart</b>.
    (Alternatively,
    select it and press <b>Enter</b>,
    or right-click it and choose <b>Open</b>.)
    <br>
    The file's contents appear in the file editor,
    looking something like this:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
class HelloWorld {

  static void main() {
    new HelloWorld().run();
  }

  HelloWorld() {
  }

  void run() {
    write("Hello World!");
  }
  
  void write(String message) {
    // the DOM library defines a global "window" variable
    HTMLDocument doc = window.document;
    HTMLParagraphElement p = doc.createElement('p');
    p.innerText = message;
    doc.body.appendChild(p);
  }
}
]]></script>
<p class="comment">
PENDING: Update this code when default code updates.
For example, there should be directives at the top.

<h2> Step 4: Run the web app </h2>

{PENDING: Intro goes here}
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    In the Libraries view,
    select the HTML file (<b>HelloWorld.html</b>) by clicking once on it.
    <br>
    The Run icon [PENDING: ICON] should now look bright green and clickable.
  <li>
    Run the app by clicking the {PENDING: ICON} icon.
    <br>
    A browser window comes up, displaying the title of your app
    ("HelloWorld)
    and the output of the Dart app
    ("Hello World!").
    <span class="comment">
    {BUG: Either add the comma to that output or delete it from my text}

<h2> Step 5: Try some Dart Editor features </h2>

<p class="comment">
{PENDING: Intro goes here. List the features they'll see,
and how they'll change the program.}

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    Put the cursor over <b>String</b> (in line 14),
    and either press <b>F3</b>
    or right-click and choose <b>Open Declaration</b>.
    <br>
    The editor displays the implementation of the
    <a href="/docs/ref/String.html"><code>String</code></a> type.
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: how do you bring up just the doc/API for String?}
    </span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Put the cursor at the end of line 19,
    press Enter and type the following line of code:
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: I'm making this up...
    It's an example of what I plan to put here.}
    </span>

    <pre>doc.</pre>

    After a small pause,
    you should see a list of autocomplete suggestions.
    <br>
    <span class="comment">
    {PENDING: this doesn't seem to be working.
    If I type Ctrl-., I see "No completions available." in red
    at the lower left of the window.}
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Press Ctl+.
    (Control and the period key)
    to cycle through autocompletion suggestions.
    <span class="comment">

    {PENDING: what do I press to get the list of suggestions?}
