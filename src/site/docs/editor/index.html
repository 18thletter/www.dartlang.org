<section id="update">
<h3>Updating without losing preferences</h3>

<p>
If you already have Dart Editor and want to keep its state,
install the new Dart Editor on top of the old one.
For example, put the new ZIP file beside the old one,
and then use the command-line interface to unzip on top of the old files:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
% cd dart-editor-installation-directory
% unzip dart-editor-LATEST_FILE.zip
replace dart/SOME_FILE? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: <b>A</b>
{% endhighlight %}

<aside>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Tip:</strong>
    If Dart Editor starts behaving strangely after you install
    on top of an old copy,
    then you might need to abandon the old state.
    Try downloading and installing a fresh copy of Dart Editor.
  </div>

<section id="view-samples">
<h2>Viewing samples</h2>

<p>
The Welcome page of Dart Editor displays a few samples.
To open a sample and look at its source code,
click the sample's image.
</p>

<p>
If you don't see the Welcome page,
you probably closed it.
Get it back with <b>Tools > Welcome Page</b>.
</p>

<p>
Another way to open a sample is by opening it
through the <b>File</b> menu.
Choose <b>File > Open Folder...</b>, then
navigate to your Dart installation directory.
Go to <b>samples</b>,
and then open your sample's directory
(for example, <b>sunflower</b>).
</p>

</section>


<section id="app">
<h2>Managing the Files view</h2>

<p>
The Files view shows the files
that implement the libraries included in Dart,
as well as all the apps that you create or open.
</p>

<p>
To keep the Files view from resetting the next time you update Dart Editor,
follow the instructions in
<a href="#update">Updating without losing preferences</a>.
</p>


<section id="app-open">
<h3>Adding apps</h3>

<p>
Here's how to open an app, which makes it appear in your Files view:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
    Go to the <b>File</b> menu,
    and choose <b>Open Folder...</b>.
    Or use the keyboard shortcut
    (<b>Ctl+O</b> or, on Mac, <b>Cmd+O</b>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <p>
    Select the directory that contains the app's files,
    and click <b>Open</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The directory and all its files appear in the Files view.
</p>
</section>


<section id="app-remove">
<h3>Removing apps</h3>

<p>
You can remove an app from the Files view,
either with or without deleting its files.
</p>

<p>
To hide the app but keep it in your file system,
right-click the directory in the Files view
(on the Mac: Ctl+click),
and choose <b>Remove from Editor</b>.
</p>

<p>
To delete the app and its files permanently,
right-click (or Ctl+click) the directory
and choose <b>Delete</b>.
</p>
</section>
</section>


<section id="create">
<h2>Creating apps</h2>

<p>
It's easy to create a simple web or command-line app from scratch:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
    Click the New Application button
    <img src="images/newapp.png" alt="New App" width="16" height="16"
     style="vertical-align:top">
    (at the upper left of Dart Editor).
    Alternatively, choose <b>File > New Application...</b>
    from the Dart Editor menu.
    A dialog appears.
    </p>
    </li>
  <li> <p>
    Type in a name for your application&mdash;for
    example, <code>HelloWorld</code>.
    If you don't like the default directory,
    type in a new location or browse to choose the location.
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>
    In the sample content section,
    select either <b>Web application</b> or <b>Command-line application</b>.
    Then click <b>Finish</b> to create the initial files for the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/DartEditor-newwebapp.png"
      alt="screenshot of the New Application dialog"
      width="605" height="530">
    </p>

    <p>
    A default Dart file appears in the Edit view,
    and its directory appears
    in the Files view.
    Your Dart Editor window should look something like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/DartEditor-helloweb.png"
      alt="screenshot of Dart Editor just after New Application..."
      width="665" height="495" >
    </p>

    </li>
  </ol>
</section>



<section id="edit">
<h2>Editing apps</h2>

<p>
Dart Editor provides the basic editing functionality you'd expect,
plus features such as
Dart code completion,
API browsing,
support for refactoring,
and the ability to search multiple files.
</p>


<section id="autocomplete">
<h3>Using autocomplete</h3>

<p>
Autocomplete suggestions look something like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/helloweb-dotcomplete.png"
  alt="snapshot of autocomplete for document."
  style="border: 1px solid black"
  width="404" height="351">
</p>

<p>
The autocomplete suggestions appear when you either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Type a class, interface, or variable name, and then type a period.
    <br />
    For example, type <code>document.</code> or <code>Math.</code>
    and pause a moment.
    Once the suggestions appear,
    continue typing to pare down the list.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Type <b>Ctl+Space</b>.
    <br />
    For example, type <code>Mat</code>, then Ctl+Space
    to see a list of classes and interfaces
    that start with "Mat".
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
When the suggestions come up,
you can click, type, or use the arrow keys to select the one you want.
Press Enter or Return to choose a suggestion,
or Esc to dismiss the panel.
</p>
</section>
</section>


<section id="browse-apis">
<h3>Browsing APIs</h3>

<p>
With Dart Editor you can easily find where APIs are declared.
You can also
outline the contents of a Dart file.
</p>

<section id="browse-api-declaration">
<h4>Finding where an API is declared</h4>

<p>
Use this feature to go to the declaration of
an API item&mdash;variable, method, type, library, and so on&mdash;either
within the same .dart file or in another file.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    In the Edit view of a Dart file,
    hold down the <b>Control</b> key
    (<b>Command</b> key on Mac)
    and move the mouse over the source code.
    A line appears under each API item.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/sunflower-hover.png"
        alt="screenshot of Command/Control-hover over Math"
        style="border: 1px solid black"
        width="371" height="152">
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Continuing to press Control or Command,
    hover over an underlined string,
    and click.
    </p>

    <p>
      The editor displays the file that declares the item.
      For example, if you Command-click Math,
      the file that declares the
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Math.html"><code>Math</code></a> type appears.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="browse-api-outline">
<h4>Outlining a file's contents</h4>

<p>
Either press <b>Alt+O</b> (<b>Option+O</b> on Mac) or
right-click and choose <b>Quick Outline</b>.
</p>

<p>
A panel comes up displaying
the classes, methods, and fields
declared in the current Dart file.
For example,
the outline for the Sunflower sample's <code>Sunflower.dart</code> file
looks something like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sunflower-outline.png"
  alt="screenshot of outline panel"
  width="350" height="300">
</p>

<p>
You can reduce the size of the list
by typing one or more characters.
For example, if you type <b>x</b>,
only the <b>xc</b> variable appears.
</p>

<p>
If you choose an item from the list&mdash;for example,
<b>xc</b>&mdash;
the editor scrolls to its declaration.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, add a more permanent outline view
by choosing <b>Tools > Outline</b>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sunflower-outline-view.png"
  alt="screenshot of outline view"
  width="673" height="494">
</p>

</section>


<section id="callers-view">
<h4>Finding where an API is used</h4>

<p>
You can find where an API&mdash;such as a function&mdash;is used
using the Callers view.
To bring it up,
click the function's name
and then choose <b>Callers</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu
(or type Ctl+Alt+H).
</p>

<p>
To see how a caller itself is called,
click its arrow in the Callers view.
For example, the following screenshot shows
that the CountDownClock() constructor and
a function named f()
call the updateTime() method.
It also shows that the constructor
is called from main().
</p>

<p>
  <img src="images/clock-callers.png"
    alt="screenshot of the Callers view"
    width="622" height="577">
</p>

<p>
Once the Callers view is visible,
you can click the Show Callee Hierarchy button
<img src="images/callees.gif" alt="" width="16" height="16"
  style="vertical-align:top">
to see <em>callees</em>&mdash;the
functions called by the function you're inspecting.
For example, the following screenshot shows
that updateTime() calls several getters and methods,
plus the now() date constructor.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="images/clock-callees.png"
    alt="screenshot of the Callers view with the callee symbol selected"
    width="622" height="577">
</p>

</section>
</section>

<section id="refactor">
<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>
To change the name of an item throughout your code,
put the cursor within (or double-click)
its name in the Edit view
and choose <b>Edit > Rename...</b>.
</p>

<p>
You can rename almost anything&mdash;local variables,
function parameters,
fields,
methods,
types,
top-level functions,
library prefixes,
top-level compilation units,
and more.
An example of renaming a top-level compilation unit is
changing the name of a file that's sourced by a library.
</p>
</section>


<section id="searching">
<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>
The search field at the upper right of the Dart Editor window
is an easy way to go directly to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Types </li>
  <li> Files </li>
  <li> Text inside of files </li>
</ul>

<p>
The scope of a text search is every file in your Files view.
Results for text searches come up in a Search view.
Within that view, double-click a file to see it in the Edit view.
All occurrences of the search string in the Edit view are highlighted.
</p>

</section>
</section>


<section id="run">
<h2>Running apps</h2>

<p>
To run any Dart app,
click Dart Editor's Run button
<img src="images/run.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"
  style="vertical-align:top">
while any file in that app is selected.
If you're working on a web app,
Dart Editor brings up a browser window
that displays the app's HTML page,
with the app's code running inside it.
</p>

<p>
When you run a web application using Dart Editor,
by default the app uses the copy of
<a href="/dartium/">Dartium</a> that's included in the Dart Editor download,
with the Dart code executing directly in the browser.
If your launch configuration specifies a browser,
then Dart Editor compiles the Dart code to JavaScript
that executes in the browser.
</p>


<section id="manage-launch">
<h3>Specifying launch configurations</h3>

<p>
Use <b>Tools > Manage Launches</b> to specify
as many launch configurations as you like.
</p>

<p>
For web apps, you can specify the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> HTML file or URL to open </li>
  <li> browser and browser arguments to use (JavaScript only) </li>
  <li> debugging enabled (Dart only) </li>
  <li> checked mode (Dart only) </li>
</ul>

<p>
For example,
a web app might have several launch configurations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A Dart (Dartium) launch configuration </li>
  <li> Several JavaScript launch configurations:
    <ul>
      <li> System default browser </li>
      <li> Google Chrome </li>
      <li> Firefox </li>
      <li> <em>...at least one configuration for each additional browser...</em> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You can specify the following for command-line apps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> .dart file to execute </li>
  <li> arguments to pass to the app </li>
  <li> checked mode </li>
  <li> heap size </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="run-production-mode">
<h3>Running in production mode</h3>

<p>
By default, apps run in checked mode.
To run in production mode instead,
disable checked mode in your app's launch configuration:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run your app at least once,
    so that it has a launch configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose <b>Run > Manage Launches</b>,
    or click the little arrow to the right of the Run button
    <img src="images/run.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"
      style="vertical-align:top">.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Manage Launches dialog,
    find a launch configuration for your app.
    Click it if it isn't already selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unselect <b>Run in checked mode</b>.
    <br>
    <img src="images/production-mode.png"
      alt="screenshot of checked mode checkbox"
      width="141" height="23">
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <b>Apply</b> to save your change,
    or <b>Run</b> to save it and run your app.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
For details about checked mode and production mode, see
<a href="/docs/language-tour/#runtime-modes">Runtime modes</a>
in the language tour.
</p>
</section>


<section id="run-non-dartium">
<h3>Specifying a browser</h3>

<p>
To specify the browser
in which the your app runs:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Choose <b>Run > Manage Launches</b>,
    or click the little arrow to the right of the Run button
    <img src="images/run.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"
      style="vertical-align:top">.
    <br>
    The Manage Launches dialog appears.
    On the left side of the dialog is a list of all launch configurations
    that you've created or that were automatically created for you.
    On the right is information about
    the currently selected launch configuration.
    <p>
      <img src="images/manage-launches.png"
        alt="screenshot of Manage Launches dialog"
        width="649" height="525">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Manage Launches dialog,
    click the Create new launch button
    <img src="images/run-create.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"
      style="vertical-align:top">,

       style="border: 1px solid black"
        width="302" height="126">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter configuration information:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Give the configuration a name that identifies the
        app, the browser, and anything else important.
        <br>
        <b>Example:</b>
        HelloWeb.html in Firefox
      </li>
      <li>
        Specify the HTML file or URL to open.
        <br>
        <b>Example:</b> /HelloWeb/HelloWeb.html
      </li>
      <li>
        Unless you want to use the default system browser,
        unselect "Use default system browser"
        and specify the location of the browser you want to use.
        <br>
        <b>Example:</b> /Applications/Firefox.app
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img src="images/new-web-launch.png"
        alt="PENDING"
        width="649" height="525">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <b>Apply</b> to save your changes,
    or <b>Run</b> to save your changes and launch the app.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Now that you've set up the launch,
you can choose it any time from the Run button
<img src="images/run.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"
  style="vertical-align:top">.
Your app will be automatically compiled to JavaScript
each time you run it.
</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="debug">
<h2>Debugging apps</h2>

<p>
You can debug both command-line and web apps with Dart Editor.
Debugging must be enabled in your launch configuration
(which it is, by default).
</p>

<aside>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Command-line debugging is currently supported for Mac
    and Linux only.
    We expect to support Windows as well.
  </div>
</aside>

<p>
Some tips for debugging:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Set breakpoints by double-clicking in the left margin of the Edit view.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the Debugger view to view your app's state
    and control its execution.
    By default, the Debugger view is to the right of the Edit view.
  </li>
  <li>
    To see the values of variables,
    mouse over the variable
    or look in the Debugging view's Call Stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because everything in Dart is an object
    and operators are really methods,
    you'll probably use Step Return (F7)
    more than you'd expect
    to climb out of Dart libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    To debug web apps, you use Dart Editor with Dartium.
    While you're debugging,
    Dart Editor takes the place of the Dartium console.
    For example, Dart Editor displays the output of print() statements.
  </li>
</ul>

<section id="dart2js">
<h2>Compiling to JavaScript</h2>

<p>
You might not need to do anything to compile your code to JavaScript.
When you run an app using a
<a href="#run-non-dartium">launch configuration that specifies a browser</a>,
Dart Editor automatically compiles the app to JavaScript
before executing it in the browser.
</p>

<p>
However, you can also compile Dart code to JavaScript without running it.
Just choose <b>Tools > Generate JavaScript</b>.
</p>

</section>

<section id="more">
<h2>Other features</h2>

<p>
Dart Editor has many additional features,
including customization and keyboard alternatives.
</p>

<section id="preferences">
<h3>Customizing Dart Editor</h3>

<p>
You can customize the editor's font, margins, key bindings, and more
using the Preferences dialog.
To bring up the dialog,
choose <b>Tools > Preferences</b>
