<section>
<h2 id="key"> Key features </h2>

<p>
Key features of the Dart language include:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Classes</dt>
  <dd>
    Classes and interfaces provide a well understood mechanism
    for efficiently defining APIs.
    These constructs enable encapsulation and reuse of methods and data.
    </dd>
  <dt>Optional types</dt>
  <dd>
    Dart programmers can optionally add static types to their code.
    Depending on programmer preference and stage of application development,
    the code can migrate from a simple, untyped experimental prototype
    to a complex, modular application with typing.
    Because types state programmer intent,
    less documentation is required to explain what is happening in the code,
    and type-checking tools can be used for debugging.
    </dd>
  <dt>Libraries</dt>
  <dd>
    Developers can create and use libraries
    that are guaranteed not to change during runtime.
    Independently developed pieces of code can therefore
    rely on shared libraries.
    </dd>
  <dt>Tooling</dt>
  <dd>
    Dart will include a rich set of
    execution environments, libraries, and development tools
    built to support the language.
    These tools will enable productive and dynamic development,
    including edit-and-continue debugging and beyond&mdash;up
    to a style where you program an application outline, run it,
    and fill in the blanks as you run.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The current release includes the Core Library
in an early prototype stage.
</p>

<section>
<h2 id="goals"> Design goals </h2>

<p>
The Dart programming language is presented here in its early stages.
The following design goals will guide
the continued evolution and refinement of this open source project:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a <b>structured yet flexible</b>
    programming language for the web.</li>
  <li>Make Dart feel <b>familiar and natural</b> to programmers
    and thus easy to learn.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all Dart language constructs allow
    <b>high performance</b> and
    <b>fast application startup</b>.</li>
  <li>Make Dart appropriate for the
    <b>full range of devices on the web</b>&mdash;including
    phones, tablets, laptops, and servers.</li>
  <li>Provide tools that make Dart run fast
    <b>across all major modern browsers</b>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
These design goals address the following problems
currently facing web developers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small scripts often evolve into
    large web applications with no apparent structure&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    hard to debug and difficult to maintain.
    In addition, these monolithic apps can&rsquo;t be split up
    so that different teams can work on them independently.
    It&rsquo;s difficult to be productive
    when a web application gets large.</li>
  <li>Scripting languages are popular
    because their lightweight nature makes it easy to write code quickly.
    Generally, the contracts with other parts of an application
    are conveyed in comments rather than in the language structure itself.
    As a result, it&rsquo;s difficult for someone other than the author
    to read and maintain a particular piece of code.</li>
  <li>With existing languages,
    the developer is forced to make a choice between
    static and dynamic languages.
    Traditional static languages require heavyweight toolchains
    and a coding style that can feel inflexible and overly constrained.</li>
  <li>Developers have not been able to create homogeneous systems
    that encompass both client and server,
    except for a few cases such as Node.js and Google Web Toolkit (GWT).
    </li>
  <li>Different languages and formats entail context switches
    that are cumbersome and add complexity to the coding process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code">Show me the code</h2>

<p>
Here are several code snippets
to give you a feel for what Dart code looks like.
</p>


<section>
<h3 id="classes">Classes and interfaces</h3>

<p>
Dart&rsquo;s interfaces and classes provide you with
a set of reusable and extensible building blocks.
An <em>interface</em> defines a basic set of methods and constants,
sometimes by inheriting from other interfaces.
A <em>class</em> can implement multiple interfaces,
but it only inherits from a single superclass.
</p>

<p>
The following example defines an interface,
along with a class and subclass that implement it:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
<b>interface Shape</b> {
  num perimeter();
}

<b>class Rectangle implements Shape</b> {
  final num height, width; 
  Rectangle(num this.height, num this.width);  // compact constructor syntax
  num perimeter() =&gt; 2*height + 2*width;       // short function syntax
}

<b>class Square extends Rectangle</b> {
  Square(num size) : super(size, size);
}
</pre>
</section>


<section>
<h3 id="optional-types">Optional types</h3>

<p>
Dart provides, at the programmer&rsquo;s option,
a mixture of static and dynamic checking.
When experimenting,
the programmer can write untyped code for simple prototyping.
As the application becomes larger and more stable,
types can be added to aid debugging and impose structure where desired.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a sample of untyped code in Dart
that creates a new Point class that has parameters
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and two methods:
<code>scale()</code> and <code>distance()</code>.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
class Point {
  var x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  scale(factor) =&gt; new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  distance() =&gt; Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

main() {
  var a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
</pre>

<p>
Here is what this code looks like with types added
that ensure that
<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>factor</code>
are of type <code>num</code>,
and that a <code>Point</code> contains two values
of type <code>num</code>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
class Point {
  num x, y;
  Point(num this.x, num this.y);
  Point scale(num factor) =&gt; new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  num distance() =&gt; Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

void main() {
  Point a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="howtouse">How can I use Dart?</h2>

<p>
You will be able to run Dart code in several ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Translate Dart code to JavaScript that can run in any modern browser:<br />
    Chrome, Safari 5+, and Firefox 4+
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Execute Dart code directly in a VM on the server side
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Use Dartboard to write, modify, and execute
    small Dart programs within any browser window
{% comment %}
    <span class="comment">{PENDING: link to Dartboard}</span>
{% endcomment %}
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<section>
<h3 id="mimetype">New MIME type</h3>

<p>
You will be able to embed a Dart program directly on an HTML page,
or you will be able to use a
<code>#import</code> or <code>#source</code> statement
to pull in external files.
Here is the proposed new MIME type,
&ldquo;application/dart&rdquo;:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-dart">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type="application/dart"&gt;
      main() {
        Element element = document.getElementById('message');
        element.innerHTML = 'Hello from Dart';
      }     
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div id="message"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; 
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>
The Dart language is accompanied by a set of tools
to aid rapid prototyping, coding, and debugging
for the entire development cycle.
Planned offerings will include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dart Editor</li>
  <li>The dartc compiler</li>
  <li>The Dart VM</li>
</ul>

<p>
As the following figure shows,
the same code can run on both the client and the server.
On the client side, the Dart code
(translated to JavaScript)
runs inside the browser and can communicate with the HTML5 DOM.
On the server side, the Dart code runs directly on the command line,
for fast iteration and for cloud-based tasks.
</p>

<section>
<h2 id="editor">Dart Editor</h2>

<p>
Taking advantage of Dart&rsquo;s structured nature,
the Dart Editor will support method name completion and refactoring.
</p>
</section>
{% endcomment %}

<section>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<p>
Dart will provide the following libraries
to support web and web server development:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Core Library </dt>
  <dd> Contains interfaces to support
    common data structures and operations.
    </dd>
  <dt> DOM Library </dt>
  <dd> Contains interfaces to the HTML5 DOM,
    loosely based on the proposed HTML5 standard
    as specified by the W3C/WHATWG.
    These interfaces will evolve in parallel with
    the HTML5 standards.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Here is an overview of the interface hierarchy for the current Core Library
(subject to change):
