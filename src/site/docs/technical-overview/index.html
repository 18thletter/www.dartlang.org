<h1>Technical Overview </h1>

<section>
  <p>
  Dart is a new class-based programming language
  for creating structured web applications.
  Developed with the goals of simplicity, efficiency, and scalability,
  the Dart language combines powerful new language features
  with familiar language constructs into a clear, readable syntax.
  </p>

  <h2> Key features </h2>

  <p>
  Key features of the Dart language include:
  </p>


  <h3>Classes</h3>
  <p>
  Classes and interfaces provide a well understood mechanism
  for efficiently defining APIs.
  These constructs enable encapsulation and reuse of methods and data.
  </p>

  <h3>Optional types</h3>
  <p>
  Dart programmers can optionally add static types to their code.
  Depending on programmer preference and stage of application development,
  the code can migrate from a simple, untyped experimental prototype
  to a complex, modular application with typing.
  Because types state programmer intent,
  less documentation is required to explain what is happening in the code,
  and type-checking tools can be used for debugging.
  </p>

  <h3>Libraries</h3>
  <p>
  Developers can create and use libraries
  that are guaranteed not to change during runtime.
  Independently developed pieces of code can therefore
  rely on shared libraries.
  </p>

  <h3>Tooling</h3>
  <p>
  Dart will include a rich set of
  execution environments, libraries, and development tools
  built to support the language.
  These tools will enable productive and dynamic development,
  including edit-and-continue debugging and beyond&mdash;up
  to a style where you program an application outline, run it,
  and fill in the blanks as you run.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="goals">
  <h2> Design goals </h2>

  <p>
  The Dart programming language is presented here in its early stages.
  The following design goals will guide
  the continued evolution and refinement of this open source project:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a <b>structured yet flexible</b>
      programming language for the web.</li>
    <li>Make Dart feel <b>familiar and natural</b> to programmers
      and thus easy to learn.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all Dart language constructs allow
      <b>high performance</b> and
      <b>fast application startup</b>.</li>
    <li>Make Dart appropriate for the
      <b>full range of devices on the web</b>&mdash;including
      phones, tablets, laptops, and servers.</li>
    <li>Provide tools that make Dart run fast
      <b>across all major modern browsers</b>. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  These design goals address the following problems
  currently facing web developers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Small scripts often evolve into
      large web applications with no apparent structure&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      hard to debug and difficult to maintain.
      In addition, these monolithic apps can&rsquo;t be split up
      so that different teams can work on them independently.
      It&rsquo;s difficult to be productive
      when a web application gets large.</li>
    <li>Scripting languages are popular
      because their lightweight nature makes it easy to write code quickly.
      Generally, the contracts with other parts of an application
      are conveyed in comments rather than in the language structure itself.
      As a result, it&rsquo;s difficult for someone other than the author
      to read and maintain a particular piece of code.</li>
    <li>With existing languages,
      the developer is forced to make a choice between
      static and dynamic languages.
      Traditional static languages require heavyweight toolchains
      and a coding style that can feel inflexible and overly constrained.</li>
    <li>Developers have not been able to create homogeneous systems
      that encompass both client and server,
      except for a few cases such as Node.js and Google Web Toolkit (GWT).
      </li>
    <li>Different languages and formats entail context switches
      that are cumbersome and add complexity to the coding process.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="code">
<h2>Show me the code</h2>

<p>
Here are several code snippets
to give you a feel for what Dart code looks like.
</p>

<section id="classes">
<h3>Classes and interfaces</h3>

<p>
Dart&rsquo;s interfaces and classes provide you with
a set of reusable and extensible building blocks.
An <em>interface</em> defines a basic set of methods and constants,
sometimes by inheriting from other interfaces.
A <em>class</em> can implement multiple interfaces,
but it only inherits from a single superclass.
</p>

<p>
The following example defines an interface,
along with a class and subclass that implement it:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
<b>interface Shape</b> {
  num perimeter();
}

<b>class Rectangle implements Shape</b> {
  final num height, width; 
  Rectangle(num this.height, num this.width);  // Compact constructor syntax.
  num perimeter() =&gt; 2*height + 2*width;       // Short function syntax.
}

<b>class Square extends Rectangle</b> {
  Square(num size) : super(size, size);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

</section> <!-- classes -->


<section id="optional-types">
<h3>Optional types</h3>

<p>
Dart provides, at the programmer&rsquo;s option,
a mixture of static and dynamic checking.
When experimenting,
the programmer can write untyped code for simple prototyping.
As the application becomes larger and more stable,
types can be added to aid debugging and impose structure where desired.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a sample of untyped code in Dart
that creates a new Point class that has parameters
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and two methods:
<code>scale()</code> and <code>distance()</code>.
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
class Point {
  var x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  scale(factor) =&gt; new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  distance() =&gt; Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

main() {
  var a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Here is what this code looks like with types added
that ensure that
<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>factor</code>
are of type <code>num</code>,
and that a <code>Point</code> contains two values
of type <code>num</code>:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
class Point {
  num x, y;
  Point(num this.x, num this.y);
  Point scale(num factor) =&gt; new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  num distance() =&gt; Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

void main() {
  Point a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<h2>How can I use Dart?</h2>

<p>
You can run Dart code in several ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Compile Dart code to JavaScript that can run in any modern browser:<br />
    Chrome, Safari 5+, and Firefox 4+ (more browser support coming shortly)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Use <a href="#dartboard">Dartboard</a> to write, modify, and execute
    small Dart programs within any browser window
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Execute Dart code directly in a VM on your computer
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    With a <a href="#mimetype">new MIME type</a>,
    use Dart in a browser
    without first compiling to JavaScript
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<aside class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong>
<a href="#editor">Dart Editor</a>
supports Dart-to-JavaScript compilation now.
The command-line tools,
such as the VM and Dart-to-JavaScript compiler,
aren't yet ready for general use.
However, you can build the command-line tools
using the source code in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/">Dart project</a>.
</aside>


<section id="editor">
<h3>Dart Editor</h3>

<p>
Dart Editor is a tool for
creating, modifying, and launching Dart web apps.
With one click, you can compile a Dart web app to JavaScript
and launch the app in a browser.
Taking advantage of Dart&rsquo;s structured nature,
Dart Editor supports method name completion,
and it will support refactoring.
</p>

<p>
For information about downloading and using Dart Editor, see the
<a href="/docs/getting-started/editor/">Dart Editor tutorial</a>.
</p>
</section>


<section id="dartboard">
<h3> Dartboard </h3>

<p>
Several pages on this site use Dartboard
so that you can see, modify, and run small Dart programs.
Besides using the embedded Dartboard,
you can also go directly to
<a href="http://try.dartlang.org">try.dartlang.org</a>.
Dartboard runs your code in the Dart VM on a remote server.
</p>
</section>

<section id="mimetype">
<h3>New MIME type</h3>

<p>
You will be able to embed a Dart program directly on an HTML page,
or you will be able to use a
<code>#import</code> or <code>#source</code> statement
to pull in external files.
Here is the proposed new MIME type,
&ldquo;application/dart&rdquo;:
</p>

{% pretty_code dart 0 %}
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type="application/dart"&gt;
      main() {
        Element element = document.getElementById('message');
        element.innerHTML = 'Hello from Dart';
      }     
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div id="message"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; 
{% endpretty_code %}

<section id="tools">
<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
The Dart language is accompanied by a set of tools
to aid rapid prototyping, coding, and debugging
for the entire development cycle.
Planned offerings will include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dart Editor</li>
  <li>The dartc compiler</li>
  <li>The Dart VM</li>
</ul>

<p>
As the following figure shows,
the same code can run on both the client and the server.
On the client side, the Dart code
(compiled to JavaScript)
runs inside the browser and can communicate with the HTML5 DOM.
On the server side, the Dart code runs directly on the command line,
for fast iteration and for cloud-based tasks.
</p>

<section id="libraries">
<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>
Dart will provide the following libraries
to support web and web server development:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core.html">Core Library</a> </dt>
  <dd> Contains interfaces to support
    common data structures and operations.
    </dd>
  <dt> DOM Library </dt>
  <dd> Contains interfaces to the HTML5 DOM,
    loosely based on the proposed HTML5 standard
    as specified by the W3C/WHATWG.
    These interfaces will evolve in parallel with
    the HTML5 standards.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The interface hierarchy for the Core Library
currently has three main parts,
which extend the following interfaces:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#iterable">Iterable</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#map">Map</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#comparable-hashable-pattern">Comparable, Hashable, and Pattern</a> </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="iterable">Iterable</h3>

<p>
  <img src='images/iterable-hierarchy.png' width="370" height="189" alt='The Iterable interface hierarchy.'>
</p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Iterable.html"><code>Iterable</code></a> interface allows you to
      get an <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a> out of an <code>Iterable</code> object.
      This interface is used by the for-in construct to iterate over an <code>Iterable</code> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Collection.html"><code>Collection</code></a> is an interface that implements
      <code>Iterable</code> and defines methods implemented by the interfaces
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Set.html"><code>Set</code></a>, <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html"><code>List</code></a>,
      and <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code></a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> is a more specific implementation of <code>Set</code>.
    </p>

<h3 id="map">Map</h3>

<p>
  <img src='images/map-hierarchy.png' width="181" height="144" alt='The Map interface hierarchy.'>
</p>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Map.html"><code>Map</code></a> interface is an associative container, mapping a key to a value. Null values are supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/HashMap.html"><code>HashMap</code></a> interface does not provide any guarantees on the order of keys and values in <code>getKeys</code> and <code>getValues</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a> interface preserves insertion order.
    </p>


<h3 id="comparable-hashable-pattern">Comparable, Hashable, and Pattern</h3>

<p>
  <img src='images/comparable-hashable-pattern.png' width="635" height="178" alt='The Comparable, Hashable, and Pattern interface hierarchy.'>
</p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a> interface is implemented by
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Date.html"><code>Date</code></a>,
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Duration.html"><code>Duration</code></a>,
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/num.html"><code>num</code></a>,
      and <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html"><code>String</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Hashable.html"><code>Hashable</code></a></a> interface is implemented by
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/num.html"><code>num</code></a> and
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html"><code>String</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Pattern.html"><code>Pattern</code></a></a> interface is implemented by
      <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html"><code>String</code></a> and
