<span>
Dart is a new class-based programming language for creating structured web applications. Developed with the goals of simplicity, efficiency, &nbsp;and scalability,</span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>
<span>
the Dart language </span>
<span>
combines</span>
<span>
&nbsp;powerful new language features with </span>
<span>
familiar language constructs</span>
<span>
&nbsp;into a clear, readable syntax.</span>

Note: </span>
<span class="c24">
This document is part of an early preview of the Dart language and programming environment. &nbsp;Some elements are missing from the current release, and the details are subject to change based on the feedback we receive.</span>
</p>
<p class="c13 c8">
<span>
Key features of the Dart language include:</span>
</p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c4">
<span class="c10">
Classes. </span>
<span>
Classes and interfaces provide a well understood mechanism for efficiently defining APIs. These constructs enable encapsulation and reuse of methods and data.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4">
<span class="c10">
Optional types. </span>
<span>
Dart programmers can optionally add static types to their code.</span>
<span>
&nbsp;Depending on programmer preference and stage of application development, the code can migrate from a simple, untyped experimental prototype to a complex, modular application with typing. </span>
<span>
Because types </span>
<span>
state programmer </span>
<span>
intent, less documentation is required to explain what is happening in the code</span>
<span>
.</span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>
</li>
<li class="c4">
<span class="c10">
Libraries</span>
<span class="c10">
. </span>
<span>
D</span>
<span>
evelopers can create and use libraries that are guaranteed not to change during runtime. Independently developed pieces of code can therefore rely on shared</span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>
<span>
libraries.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4">
<span class="c10">
Tooling. </span>
<span>
Dart &nbsp;will include </span>
<span>
a rich set of execution environments, libraries, and development tools</span>
<span>
&nbsp;built to support the language. </span>
<span>
These tools will enable productive and dynamic development, including </span>
<span>
edit-and-continue debugging and beyond&mdash;up to a style where you program an application outline, run it, and fill in the blanks as you run.</span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>
<span>
The current release includes the VM, Core Libraries, compiler, all in an early prototype stage.</span>

Design goals</span>
</h3>
<p class="c18">
<span class="c14">
The Dart programming language is presented here in its early stages. The following design goals will guide the continued evolution and refinement of this open source project:</span>
</p>
<p class="c7">
<span class="c10">
</span>
</p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c15">
<span class="c14">
Create a </span>
<span class="c10 c14">
structured yet flexible </span>
<span class="c14">
programming language for </span>
<span class="c14">
the web.</span>
</li>
<li class="c15">
<span class="c14">
Make Dart feel </span>
<span class="c10 c14">
familiar</span>
<span class="c14">
&nbsp;</span>
<span class="c10 c14">
and natural </span>
<span class="c14">
to programmers and thus easy to learn.</span>
</li>
<li class="c15">
<span>
Ensure that all Dart language constructs allow </span>
<span class="c10 c14">
high performance</span>
<span class="c14">
&nbsp;and </span>
<span class="c10 c14">
fast application startup</span>
<span class="c14">
.</span>
</li>
<li class="c15">
<span>
Make Dart appropriate for the </span>
<span class="c10">
full range of devices on the web</span>
<span>
&mdash;</span>
<span>
including phones, tablets, laptops, and servers.</span>
</li>
<li class="c15">
<span>
Provide tools that make Dart run fast </span>
<span class="c10">
across all major modern browsers</span>
<span>
.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="c1 c8">
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="c13 c8">
<span>
These design goals address the following problems currently facing web developers: </span>
</p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c4">
<span>
Small scripts often evolve into large web applications with no apparent structure&mdash;they&rsquo;re hard to debug and difficult to maintain. In addition, these monolithic apps can&rsquo;t be split up so that different teams can work on them independently. It&rsquo;s difficult to be productive when a web application gets large.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c4">
<span>
Scripting languages are popular because their lightweight nature makes it easy to write code quickly. Generally, the contracts with other parts of an application are conveyed in comments rather than in the language structure itself. As a result, it&rsquo;s difficult for someone other than the author to read and maintain a particular piece of code.</span>
</li>
<li class="c11 c9">
<span>
With existing languages, the developer is forced to make a choice between static and dynamic languages. Traditional static languages require heavyweight toolchains and a coding style that can feel inflexible and overly constrained.</span>
</li>
<li class="c11 c9">
<span>
Developers have not been able to create homogeneous systems that encompass both client and server. Different languages and formats entail context switches that are cumbersome and add complexity to the coding process.</span>

Classes and interfaces</span>

<p class="c13 c8">
<span>
Dart&rsquo;</span>
<span>
s interfaces and classes </span>
<span>
provide you with a set of reusable and extensible building blocks</span>
<span>
.</span>
<span>
&nbsp;An </span>
<span class="c27">
interface</span>
<span>
&nbsp;defines a basic set of methods and constants, sometimes by inheriting from other interfaces. A </span>
<span class="c27">
class</span>
<span>
&nbsp;can implement multiple interfaces, but it only inherits from a single superclass.</span>
</p>
<p class="c13 c8">

Optional types</span>
</h4>
<p class="c8 c13">
<span>
Dart provides, at the programmer&rsquo;s option, a mixture of static and dynamic checking. When experimenting, the programmer can write untyped code for simple prototyping. As the application becomes larger and more stable, types can be added to aid debugging and impose structure where desired.</span>
</p>
<p class="c13 c8">
<span>
For example, here is a sample of untyped code in Dart that creates a new </span>
<span class="c2">
Point</span>
<span>
&nbsp;class that has parameters </span>
<span class="c2">
x</span>
<span>
&nbsp;and </span>
<span class="c2">
y</span>
<span>
&nbsp;</span>
<span>
and two methods: </span>
<span class="c2">
scale()</span>
<span>
&nbsp;and </span>
<span class="c2">
distance()</span>
<span>
.</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c2 c6">
class Point</span>
<span class="c2 c6">

</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c2 c6">

</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c2 c6">
&nbsp; scale(factor) =&gt; new Point(x*factor, y*factor);</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c2 c6">
&nbsp; distance() =&gt; Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c2 c6">
}</span>

<p class="c7 c16">
