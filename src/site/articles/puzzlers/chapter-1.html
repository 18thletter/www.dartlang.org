<p>
Years ago I co-wrote a book called
<em>Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases</em>.
Now that I’m on the Dart team,
I'm translating all of these puzzlers to Dart to see if they still puzzle,
and if they have anything useful to tell us about the Dart design.
Here's the first chapter's worth.

<h2 id="1"> Puzzler 1: Oddity </h2>

<p>
This method appears to tell you whether its argument is odd or even,
but fails on negative odd arguments:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public static boolean isOdd(int i) {
  return i % 2 == 1;
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
The puzzler was fixed in Dart:
The following function <em>does</em> identify odd numbers in Dart (unlike Java):
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
bool isOdd(int i) {
  return i % 2 == 1;
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
That said, I'm not so sure the cure is any better than the disease;
the resulting arithmetic violates the "Division Rule":
</p>

<blockquote>
D = d * (D div d) + D mod d
</blockquote>

<p>
It’s also incompatible with JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and C#.
I've been discussing this issue with
<a href="/authors/florian-loitsch.html">Florian Loitsch</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="2"> Puzzler 2: Time for a Change </h2>

<p>
This program appears to calculate the change
when $2.00 is paid for a $0.90 purchase.
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public class Change {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println(2.00 - 1.10);
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Here it is translated into Dart:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
main() {
  print(2.00 - 1.10);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
In Java and Dartboard, it prints 0.8999999999999999.
Using the Dart VM, it (currently) prints 0.9,
but this is because we’re currently using C’s formatting functions;
in the near future, the Dart VM will display
the same (puzzling) behavior as Dartboard.
</p>

<p>
This raises the question,
should Dart support decimal floating point arithmetic natively?
There are many who would argue that it should.
One man (Mike Cowlishaw, former IBM Fellow)
devoted a good chunk of his life to this:
<a href="http://speleotrove.com/decimal">http://speleotrove.com/decimal</a>.
C# does support 128-bit floating decimals, for what it’s worth.
But if you’re deploying to JavaScript,
floating-point decimal arithmetic will be ungodly slow,
and it won’t be fast anywhere
(except, perhaps, on IBM’s Power6 chip,
which supports floating decimal natively,
due to the efforts of the aforementioned Mike Cowlishaw).
Incidentally, Cowlishaw was on the EcmaScript committee,
and did get decimal arithmetic into the ill-fated EcmaScript 4.
</p>

<p>
If Dart does provide library support for floating point decimal arithmetic,
should we provide linguistic support for decimal literals?
</p>

<p>
As you’re doubtless aware,
the floating point binary problem is worse in Dart
than when you compile to JavaScript.
In Java, most programmers know enough to use int rather than double
to avoid these problems.
But consider the following Dart program:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
main() {
  int i = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;
  print(i == i + 1);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
When you run it on Dartboard,
it prints true, which is <em>really</em> confusing.
I don’t think we can, in good conscience, support this behavior.
But I understand that this is a hard, over-constrained problem.
</p>


<h2 id="3"> Puzzler 3: Long Division </h2>

<p>
This Java program would appear to
print the number of microseconds per millisecond,
which is 1000.
In fact, it prints 5:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public class LongDivision {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final long MICROS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000;
    final long MILLIS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

    System.out.println(MICROS_PER_DAY / MILLIS_PER_DAY);
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This puzzler doesn’t apply directly to Dart
because it has no long type,
and was fixed because Dart's int type is arbitrary-precision.
If you label the variables as int,
the correct answer is printed (1000).
Dartboard happens to calculate the correct value in this case,
but there's no guarantee that it will do so in general.
</p>


<h2 id="4"> Puzzler 4: It's Elementary </h2>

{% pretty_code %}
public class Elementary {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(12345 + 5432l); // Lowercase L masquerades as 1!
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This puzzler doesn’t apply to Dart,
as there are no long (64-bit) literals in Dart.
</p>


<h2 id="5"> Puzzler 5: The Joy of Hex </h2>

<p>
This Java program looks like it should print <code>1cafebabe</code>
but actually prints <code>cafebabe</code> due to unexpected sign extension
(<code>0xcafebabe</code> is a negative number).

{% pretty_code %}
public class JoyOfHex {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(
      Long.toHexString(0x100000000L + 0xcafebabe));
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This was fixed in Dart,
by the use of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.
This Dart program prints <code>1cafebabe</code>:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
main() {
  print((0x100000000 + 0xcafebabe).toRadixString(16));
}
{% endpretty_code %}


<h2 class="6"> Puzzler 6: Multicast </h2>

{% pretty_code %}
public class Multicast {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println((int) (char) (byte) -1);
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This puzzle doesn't apply in Dart as it has no casts.
</p>


<h2 class="7"> Puzzler 7: Swap Meat </h2>

<p>
This program attempts to use a hideous hack
to swap the contents of two int variables:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public class CleverSwap {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 1984;
    int y = 2001;
    x ^= y ^= x ^= y;
    System.out.println("x = " + x + "; y = " + y);
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
In Dart:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
main() {
  int x = 1984;
  int y = 2001;
  x ^= y ^= x ^= y;
  print("x = ${x}; y = ${y}");
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This puzzler behaves exactly the same in Java and Dart.
Luckily, it doesn't indicate a language problem:
It's just a cautionary tale regarding
overly clever programming and premature optimization.
(For what it’s worth, the Rube Goldberg “fix” in the book also
applies equally well to Dart and Java.)
</p>


<h2 id="8"> Puzzler 8: Dos Equis </h2>

<p>
This program would appear to print <code>XX</code>,
but actually prints <code>X88</code> in Java:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public class DosEquis {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char x = 'X';
    int i = 0;
    System.out.print(true  ? x : 0);
    System.out.print(false ? i : x);
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
In Dart:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
main() {
  string x = 'X';
  int i = 0;
  print(true  ? x : 0);
  print(false ? i : x);
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This puzzle is fixed in Dart,
because Dart doesn’t have a char type that is a (barely) glorified int type,
doesn’t do primitive widening conversions on ternary expressions,
and doesn't have weird rules concerning small int values
(don't ask; read the book if you’re morbidly curious).
</p>


<h2 id="#9"> Puzzler 9: Tweedledum </h2>

<p>
In this puzzle, you’re asked to provide declarations
to cause the indicated behavior:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
Public class Tweedledum {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Put your declarations for x and i here

    x += i;     // Must be LEGAL
    x = x + i;  // Must be ILLEGAL
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
Fixed in Dart:
no short type,
no implicit narrowing conversion on compound assignment expressions.
</p>


<h2 id="10"> Puzzler 10: Tweedledee </h2>

<p>
Again, you’re asked to provide declarations to cause the indicated behavior:
</p>

{% pretty_code %}
public class Tweedledee {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Put your declarations for x and i here

    x = x + i;  // Must be LEGAL
    x += i;     // Must be ILLEGAL
  }
}
{% endpretty_code %}

<p>
This one is fixed in Dart;
in fact, it’s even fixed in Java, as of 1.6.
It had to do with peculiarities of Java's String concatenation operator
and its corresponding compound assignment operator.
</p>

<h2 id="summary"> Summary </h2>

<p>
Out of ten Java puzzlers,
eight have been fixed in Dart,
one (Puzzler 3) arguably made worse
(it's easier to get into floating point binary troubles),
and one doesn't really indicate a language problem (Puzzler 7).
