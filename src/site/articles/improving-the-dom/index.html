<h1>Improving the DOM</h1>
<p>
<em>Written by Bob Nystrom<br />

</p>

<p>One of the great opportunities a new language gives you is a chance to also define a cleaner set of APIs for users to work with. When it comes to coding in a browser, that API is the DOM. The DOM API that JavaScripters suffer is creaking under the weight of history and technological ballast such as XML.</p>

<p>We have the chance to blow away a lot of that history and were lucky enough to get <a href="http://infrequently.org/">Alex Russell</a> and <a href="http://erik.eae.net/">Erik Arvidsson</a> to help us lay out what the DOM could have looked like if we had a time machine. What we have still needs a lot of work and feedback from people like you, but it's already promising. Here's a glimpse.</p>

<h2>Simpler names</h2>

<p>The simplest changes were just cleaning up some painful names. <code>HTMLElement</code> is just <code>Element</code> and we've dropped <code>HTML</code> from most of the type names. Instead of <code>childNodes</code> and <code>children</code> we have <code>nodes</code> and <code>elements</code>. <code>ownerDocument</code> is just <code>document</code>. We've tried to optimize names so that the things you use the most are the most terse.</p>

<h2>Better querying</h2>

<p>One area where the DOM has a bunch of baggage is finding elements. Today's DOM has a pile of methods for finding stuff:</p>

<pre>
getElementsById()
getElementsByTagName()
getElementsByName()
getElementsByClassName()
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()
document.links
document.images
document.forms
document.scripts
formElement.elements
selectElement.options
</pre>

<p>All of this piled up before <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> appeared on a mountaintop to give us the revelation that <em>Thou Shalt Find Nodes By Using CSS Selectors</em>. With the One True Way in hand, we've stripped it down to just two (!) methods: <code>query()</code> and <code>queryAll()</code>.</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
elem.getElementById('foo');
elem.getElementsByTagName('div');
elem.getElementsByName('foo');
elem.getElementsByClassName('foo');
elem.querySelector('.foo .bar');
elem.querySelectorAll('.foo .bar');
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
elem.query('#foo');
elem.queryAll('div');
elem.queryAll('[name="foo"]');
elem.queryAll('.foo');
elem.query('.foo .bar');
elem.queryAll('.foo .bar');
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The idea here is that if you want to use a library like jQuery, that's fine, but you shouldn't <em>have</em> to just to make the API palatable.</p>

<h2>Use real collections</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the DOM collection types are different from the built-in Array type, which trips users up when methods they use on one aren't available on the other. For Dart, we've cleaned that up. Methods like <code>elements</code>, <code>nodes</code>, and <code>query()</code> that return collections do so by returning objects that implement the Dart core library's built-in collection interfaces. They either <em>are</em> regular Dart lists, maps, and sets, or they are interchangeable with them.</p>

<p>Building on top of Dart's collection types lets us get rid of a bunch of special-case methods too. Instead of a bunch of methods on <code>Element</code> for working with attributes, we just made <code>attributes</code> a map:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
elem.hasAttribute('name');
elem.getAttribute('name')
elem.setAttribute('name', 'value');
elem.removeAttribute('name');
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
elem.attributes.contains('name');
elem.attributes['name'];
elem.attributes['name'] = 'value';
elem.attributes.remove('name');
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Likewise, by making <code>nodes</code> and <code>elements</code> full-featured collections, we can get rid of a bunch of methods on <code>Element</code> and <code>Node</code>:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
elem.hasChildNodes();
elem.firstChild();
elem.appendChild(child);
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
elem.nodes.isEmpty();
elem.nodes[0];
elem.nodes.add(child);
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Use constructors</h2>

<p>In order to create new instances of DOM types, you're forced to go through factory methods on the document. We like constructors:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
document.createElement('div');
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
new Element.tag('div');
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Or how about:</p>

<pre>
TableElement table = new Element.html(
    '&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;Dart!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/table&gt;');
</pre>

<p>We're still fleshing this out, but with Dart's named constructors, we should be able to make it pretty easy to conjure up DOM objects in a variety of ways.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Finally, the biggest change, and I think the most useful one. We've cleaned up how event handlers are bound. The DOM has two ways of working with events. The old way is that you can bind a single handler by setting one of the <code>on___</code> properties on the element directly. (For mysterious reasons, these are named <code>allinlowercase</code> unlike the rest of the DOM.)</p>

<p>The more modern way is by using <code>addEventListener()</code> and <code>removeEventListener()</code>. That safely allows multiple listeners for the same event, which is great, but it's painfully verbose. You also identify the event type by its string name, which is error-prone and doesn't play nice with the type system.</p>

<p>We've simplified that. We killed all of the <code>on___</code> properties on Element and then created a new ElementEvents class. For each of the known event types, there is a property on that class: <code>click</code>, <code>mouseDown</code>, etc. Each of those properties is an event object that can add and remove listeners and dispatch events.</p>

<p>We wired that back up to the DOM by giving Element a property called <code>on</code> that accesses it. Now all of the event-related functionality is tucked away in a single property. On the off chance that you <em>do</em> want to register a dynamically-named event, we also put a subscript operator on NodeEvents. That's a lot of text. Here's some code:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
elem.addEventListener('click',
    (event) => print('click!'), false);

elem.removeEventListener(
    'click', listener);
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
elem.on.click.add(
    (event) => print('click!'));

elem.on.click.remove(listener);
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For the rare times where you do need to work with events generically, or dynamically generate their names, we also added a subscript operator to NodeEvents so you can do that too:</p>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// Old:
elem.addEventListener(
    'some' + 'name',
    (event) => print('dynamic!'),
    false);
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50%">
<pre>
// New:
elem.on['some' + 'name'].add(
    (event) => print('dynamic!'));
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Some DOM classes support more events than just the stuff in Element. For those, there are subclasses of ElementEvents that add more properties. For example, Document's <code>on</code> returns a DocumentEvents class that adds <code>readyStateChange</code>, <code>selectionChange</code>, and <code>contentLoaded</code>.</p>
